<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>It was the intention of the writer to publish
a narrative descriptive of his overland
tour from the Atlantic to the Pacific
soon after returning from California in
1876, and his excuse for the delay in
publication is that a variety of circumstances
compelled him to postpone for a
time the duty of arranging the contents of his journal
until other pressing matters had been satisfactorily
attended to. Again, considerable unfinished literary
work, set aside when he began preparation for crossing
the Continent, had to be resumed, and for these
reasons the story of his journey from "<span class="smcap">Ocean
to Ocean on Horseback</span>" is only now ready for
the printer. In view of this delay in going to press,
the author will endeavor to show a due regard for the
changes time has wrought along his line of march, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
while noting the incidents of his long ride from day to
day, it has been his aim so far as possible to discuss the
regions traversed, the growth of cities and the development
of their industries from the standpoint of the
present.</p>

<h2>OCEAN TO OCEAN</h2>
<h3>ON</h3>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTORY.</h3>
<p>From earliest boyhood it had been my
earnest desire to see and learn from personal
observation all that was possible
of the wonderful land of my birth.
Passing from the schoolroom to the
War of the Rebellion and thence back
to the employments of peace, the old
longing to make a series of journeys
over the American Continent again
took possession of me and was the controlling incentive
of all my ambitions and struggles for many
years.</p>
<p>To see New England—the home of my ancestors;
to visit the Middle and Western States; to look upon
the majestic Mississippi; to cross the Great Plains; to
scale the mountains and to look through the Golden
Gate upon the far-off Pacific were among the cherished
desires through which my fancy wandered before leaving
the Old Home and village school in Northern New
York.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>The want of an education and the want of money
were two serious obstacles which confronted me for a
time. Without the former I could not prosecute my
journeys intelligently and for want of the latter I
could not even attempt them.</p>
<p>Aspiring to an academic and collegiate course of
study, but being at that period entirely without means
for the accomplishment of my purpose, I left the district
school of my native town and sought to raise the
necessary funds by trapping for mink and other fur-bearing
animals along the Oswegatchie and its tributary
streams. This venture proving successful I entered
the academy at Gouverneur in August, 1857,
from which institution I was appointed to the State
Normal College at Albany in the fall of 1859.</p>
<p>I had been in Albany but six weeks when it became
apparent that if I continued at the Normal I would
soon be compelled to part with my last dollar for
board and clothing.</p>
<p>The years 1859-60 were spent alternately at Albany
as student and in the village schools of Rensselaer
County as teacher—the latter course being resorted to
whenever money was needed with which to meet current
expenses at the Normal School.</p>
<p>Then came our great Civil Conflict overriding every
other consideration. Books were thrown aside and the
pursuits of the student and teacher supplanted by the
sterner and more arduous duties of the soldier.</p>
<p>During my three years of camping and campaigning
with the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac I was
enabled to gratify to some extent my desire for travel
and to see much of interest as the shifting scenes of
war led Bayard, Stoneman, Pleasonton, Gregg, Custer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Davies and Kilpatrick and their followers over the
hills and through the valleys of Virginia, Maryland
and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Being captured in a cavalry battle between Kilpatrick
and Stuart in October, 1863, I was imprisoned
successively at Richmond, Danville, Macon, Savannah,
Charleston and Columbia, from which last prison I
escaped in November, 1864; was recaptured and escaped
a second and third time, traversing the States of
South Carolina and Georgia in my long tramp from
Columbia to Savannah.</p>
<p>The marches, raids, battles, captures and escapes of
those days seem to have increased rather than diminished
my ardor for travel and adventure and hence it
is possibly not strange that on leaving the army I still
looked forward to more extended journeys in the East
and exploratory tours beyond the Mississippi.</p>
<p>With the close of the war and mustering out of service
came new duties and responsibilities which I had
hardly contemplated during my school days. The
question of ways and means again confronted me. I
desired first to continue the course of study which had
been interrupted by my enlistment, and secondly to
carry out my cherished plans for exploration. Having
a journal kept during my incarceration in and
escapes from Southern prisons, I was advised and decided
to amplify and publish it if possible with a view
to promoting these projects.</p>
<p>Going to New York, I at once sought the leading
publishers. My manuscript was submitted to the
Harpers, Appletons, Scribners, and some others,
but as I was entirely unknown, few cared to undertake
the publication and none seemed disposed to allow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
a royalty which to me at least seemed consistent
with the time and labor expended in preparation. I
had now spent my last dollar in the Metropolis in
pursuit of a publisher, and in this dilemma it was
thought best to return to Albany, where I had friends
and perhaps some credit, and endeavor to bring out the
book by subscription. This course would compel me
to assume the cost of production, but if successful
would prove much more lucrative than if issued in the
usual way through the trade.</p>
<p>Fully resolved upon retracing my steps to Albany,
I was most fortunate in meeting an old comrade and
friend to whom I frankly stated my plans and circumstances.
He immediately loaned me twenty dollars
with which to continue my search for a publisher and
to meet in the meantime necessary current expenses.</p>
<p>On reaching Albany an attic room and meals were
secured for a trifling sum, arrangements made with a
publisher, and the work of getting out the book begun.
While the printer was engaged in composing, stereotyping,
printing and binding the work, I employed
my spare time in a door-to-door canvass of the city for
subscriptions, promising to deliver on the orders as
soon as the books came from the press. In this way
the start was made and before the close of the year
hundreds of agencies were established throughout the
country.</p>
<p>The venture proved successful beyond my most sanguine
expectations, and where I had expected to dispose
of two or three editions and to realize a few hundred
dollars from the sale of "Capture, Prison-Pen
and Escape," the book had a sale of over 400,000
copies and netted me $75,000, This remarkable success,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
rivalling in its financial results even "Uncle Tom's
Cabin," which had just had a run of 300,000 copies,
was most gratifying and led to the publication, at intervals,
of "Three Years in the Federal Cavalry,"
"Battles for the Union," and "Heroes of Three
Wars."</p>
<p>The temptation to make the most of my literary
ventures lured me on from year to year until 1875,
when I laid down the pen and began preparation for
my long contemplated and oft deferred journey across
the Continent. Being now possessed of ample means,
I proposed to ride at leisure on a tour of observation
from <span class="smcap">OCEAN TO OCEAN ON HORSEBACK</span>.</p>
<p>My preference for an equestrian journey was in a
great measure due to early associations with the horse,
in jaunts along country highways and over the hills
after the cows, as well as numerous boyhood adventures
in which this noblest of animals frequently played a
conspicuous part. Then, too, my experience in the
cavalry largely influenced me to adopt the saddle as
the best suited to my purpose.</p>
<p>Reflecting further upon the various modes of travel,
I was led to conclude as the result of much experience
that he who looks at the country from the windows of
a railway car, can at best have only an imperfect idea
of the many objects of interest which are constantly
brought to his notice. Again, a journey in the saddle,
wherein the rider mounts and dismounts at will as he
jogs along over the highway, chatting with an occasional
farmer, talking with the people in town and
gazing upon rural scenes at his pleasure, presents many
attractive features to the student and tourist who
wishes to view the landscape, to commune with nature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to see men and note the products of their toil and
to learn something of their manners and customs.</p>
<p>Having therefore decided to make my journey in the
saddle, I at once set about to secure such a horse as
was likely to meet the requirements of my undertaking.
As soon as my purpose was known, horses of
every grade, weight and shade were thrust upon my
attention and after some three weeks spent in advertising,
talks with horse fanciers and in the livery and sale
stables of Boston, my choice fell upon a Kentucky
Black Hawk, one of the finest animals I had ever seen
and, as was subsequently established, just the horse I
wanted for my long ride from sea to sea.</p>
<p>His color was coal black, with a white star in the
forehead and four white feet; long mane and tail;
height fifteen hands; weight between ten and eleven
hundred pounds, with an easy and graceful movement
under the saddle; his make-up was all that could be desired
for the objects I had in view. The price asked
for this beautiful animal was promptly paid, and it was
generally conceded that I had shown excellent judgment
in the selection of my equine companion.</p>
<p>A few days after my purchase I learned that my
four-legged friend had been but a short time before the
property of an ex-governor of Massachusetts and that
the reason he had but recently found his way into a livery
stable on Portland street, was that he had acquired
the very bad habit of running away whenever he saw
a railway train or anything else, in short, that tended
to disturb his naturally excitable nature. This information
led to no regrets, however, nor did it even
lessen my regard for the noble animal which was destined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
soon to be my sole companion in many a lonely
ride and adventure.</p>
<p>The unsavory reputation he had made, and possibly
of which he was very proud, of running away upon
the slightest provocation, smashing up vehicles and
scattering their occupants to the four winds, was considered
by his new master a virtue rather than a fault, so
long as he ran in the direction of San Francisco, and
did not precipitate him from his position in the saddle.</p>
<p>As soon as I was in possession of my horse the
question of a suitable name arose and it was agreed
after some discussion among friends that he should be
christened <i>Paul Revere</i>, after that stirring patriot of
the Revolution who won undying fame by his ride
from Boston and appeals to the yeomanry the night
before the Battle of Lexington.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>BOSTON AND ITS ENVIRONS.</h3>
<p>The month of April, 1876, found myself
and horse fully equipped and ready
to leave Boston, but I will not ride
away from the metropolis of New
England without some reference to its
early history and remarkable development,
nor without telling the reader of
my lecture at Tremont Temple and
other contemplated lectures in the leading
cities and towns along my route.</p>
<p>Boston, standing on her three hills with the torch
of learning in her hand for the illumination of
North, South, East and West, is not one of your
ordinary every-day cities, to be approached without
due introduction. Like some ancient dame of historic
lineage, her truest hospitality and friendliest face are
for those who know her story and properly appreciate
her greatness, past and present. Before visiting her,
therefore, I recalled to memory those facts which
touch us no more nearly than a dream on the pages
of written history, but when studied from the living
models and relics gain much life, color and verisimilitude.</p>
<p>Boston Harbor, with its waters lying in azure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
placidity over the buried boxes of tea which the hasty
hands of the angered patriots hurled to a watery
grave; Boston Common, whose turf grows velvet-green
over ground once blackened by the fires of the
grim colonial days of witch-burning, and again
trampled down by innumerable soldierly feet in
Revolutionary times; the Old State House, from
whose east window the governor's haughty command,
"Disperse, ye rebels!" sounded on the occasion of
the "Boston Massacre," the first shedding of American
blood by the British military; and the monument of
Bunker Hill—these, with a thousand and one other
reminders of the city's brilliant historical record, compose
the Old Boston which I was prepared to see.
The first vision, however, of that many-sided city
was almost bewilderingly different from the mental
picture. Where was the quaint Puritan town of the
colonial romances? Where were its crooked, winding
streets, its plain uncompromising meeting-houses,
darkened with time, its curious gabled houses, stooping
with age? Around me everything was shining
with newness—the smooth wide streets, beautifully
paved, the splendid examples of <i>fin de siècle</i> architecture
in churches, public buildings, school houses and
dwellings.</p>
<p>Afterwards I realized that there was a New Boston,
risen Phoenix-like from the ashes of its many conflagrations,
and an Old Boston, whose "outward and
visible signs" are best studied in that picturesque,
shabby stronghold of ancient story, now rapidly degenerating
into a "slum" district—the North End.</p>
<p>Boston, viewed without regard to its history, is
indeed "Hamlet presented without the part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Hamlet." It would be interesting to conjecture what
the city's present place and condition might be, had
Governor Winthrop's and Deputy-Governor Dudley's
plan of making "New-towne"—the Cambridge of to-day—the
Bay Colony's principal settlement, been executed.
Instead, and fortunately, Governor Winthrop
became convinced of the superiority of Boston as an
embryo "county seat." "Trimountain," as it was first
called, was bought in 1630 from Rev. William
Blackstone, who dwelt somewhere between the Charles
River and what is now Louisburg Square, and held
the proprietary right of the entire Boston Peninsula—a
sort of American Selkirk, "monarch of all he
surveyed, and whose right there was none to dispute."
He was "bought off," however, for the modest
sum of <i>£</i>30, and retired to what was then the
wilderness, on the banks of the Blackstone River—named
after him—and left "Trimountain" to the
settlers. Then Boston began to grow, almost with
the quickness of Jack's fabled beanstalk. Always
one of the most important of colonial towns, it conducted
itself in sturdy Puritan style, fearing God,
honoring the King—with reservations—burning
witches and Quakers, waxing prosperous on codfish,
and placing education above every earthly thing
in value, until the exciting events of the Revolution,
which has left behind it relics which make Boston a
veritable "old curiosity shop" for the antiquarian, or
indeed the ordinary loyal American, who can spend a
happy day, or week, or month, prowling around the
picturesque narrow streets, crooked as the proverbial
ram's horn, of Old Boston.</p>
<p>He will perhaps turn first, as I did, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
"cradle of Liberty"—Faneuil Hall. A slight
shock will await him, possibly, in the discovery that
under the ancient structure, round which hover so
many imperishable memories of America's early
struggles for freedom, is a market-house, where thrifty
housewives and still more thrifty farmers chaffer,
chat and drive bargains the year round, and which
brings into the city a comfortable annual income of
$20,000. But the presence of the money-changers
in the temple of Freedom does not disturb the "solid
men of Boston," who are practical as well as public-spirited.
The market itself is as old as the hall,
which was erected by the city in 1762, to take the
place of the old market-house, which Peter Faneuil
had built at his own expense and presented to the
city in 1742, and which was burned down in 1761.</p>
<p>The building is an unpretending but substantial
structure, plainly showing its age both in the exterior
and the interior. Its size—seventy-four feet long by
seventy-five feet wide—is apparently increased by the
lack of seats on the main floor and even in the gallery,
where only a few of these indispensable adjuncts to the
comfort of a later luxurious generation are provided.
The hall is granted rent free for such public or political
meetings as the city authorities may approve, and probably
is only used for gatherings where, as in the old days,
the participants bring with them such an excess of
effervescent enthusiasm as would make them unwilling
to keep their seats if they had any. The walls are
embellished by portraits of Hancock, Washington,
Adams, Everett, Lincoln, and other great personages,
and by Healy's immense painting—sixteen by thirty
feet—of "Webster Replying to Hayne."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>For a short time Faneuil Hall was occupied by
the Boston Post Office, while that institution, whose
early days were somewhat restless ones, was seeking
a more permanent home. For thirty years after the
Revolution, it was moved about from pillar to post,
occupying at one time a building on the site of Boston's
first meeting-house, and at another the Merchants'
Exchange Building, whence it was driven by
the great fire of 1872. Faneuil Hall was next
selected as the temporary headquarters, next the Old
South Church, after which the Post Office—a veritable
Wandering Jew among Boston public institutions—was
finally and suitably housed under its own roof-tree,
the present fine building on Post Office Square.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption0">

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption0">VIEWS IN BOSTON.</span>
</div>
<p>To the Old South Church itself, the sightseer next
turns, if still bent on historical pilgrimages. This
venerable building of unadorned brick, whose name
figures so prominently in Revolutionary annals, stands
at the corner of Washington and Milk streets. Rows
of business structures, some of them new and clean as
a whistle and almost impertinently eloquent of the importance
of this world and its goods, cluster around
the old church and hem it in, but are unable to jostle
it out of the quiet dignity with which it holds its
place, its heavenward-pointing spire preaching the
sermons against worldliness which are no longer
heard within its ancient walls. To every window the
fanciful mind can summon a ghost—that of Benjamin
Franklin, who was baptized and attended service
here; Whitfield, who here delivered some of the
soul-searching, soul-reaching sermons, which swept
America like a Pentecostal flame; Warren, who here
uttered his famous words on the anniversary of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Boston Massacre; of the patriot-orators of the Revolution
and the organizers of the Boston Tea-Party,
which first took place as a definite scheme within
these walls. Here and there a red-coated figure would
be faintly outlined—one of the lawless troop of
British soldiers who in 1775 desecrated the church by
using it as a riding-school.</p>
<p>At present the church is used as a museum, where
antique curiosities and historical relics are on exhibition
to the public, and the Old South Preservation
Committee is making strenuous efforts to save the
building from the iconoclastic hand of Progress, which
has dealt blows in so many directions in Boston, destroying
a large number of interesting landmarks. Its
congregation left it long ago, in obedience to that inexorable
law of change and removal, which leaves so
many old churches stranded amid the business sections
of so many of our prominent cities, and settled in the
"New Old South Church" at Dartmouth and Boylston
streets.</p>
<p>It is curious and in its way disappointing to us visitors
from other cities to see what "a clean sweep" the
broom of improvement has been permitted in a city so
intensely and justly proud of its historical associations
as Boston. Year by year the old landmarks disappear
and fine new buildings rise in their places and
Boston is apparently satisfied that all is for the best.
The historic Beacon, for which Beacon Hill was named
and which was erected in 1634 to give alarm to the
country round about in case of invasion, is not only
gone, but the very mound where it stood has been
levelled, this step having been taken in 1811. The
Beacon had disappeared ten years before and a shaft<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
sixty feet high, dedicated to the fallen heroes of
Bunker Hill, had been erected on the spot and of
course removed when the mound was levelled. The
site of Washington's old lodgings at Court and Hanover
street—a fine colonial mansion, later occupied by
Daniel Webster and by Harrison Gray Otis, the celebrated
lawyer—is now taken up by an immense
wholesale and retail grocery store; the splendid Hancock
mansion, where the Revolutionary patriot entertained
Lafayette, D'Estaing, and many other notabilities
of the day, was torn down in 1863, despite the protests
of antiquarian enthusiasts. The double house,
in one part of which Lafayette lived in 1825, is still
standing; the other half of it was occupied during his
lifetime by a distinguished member of that unsurpassed
group of <i>literati</i> who helped win for Boston so
much of her intellectual pre-eminence—George
Ticknor, the Spanish historian, the friend of Holmes,
Lowell, Whittier and Longfellow, from whom the
latter is supposed to have drawn his portrait of the
"Historian" in his "Tales of a Wayside Inn." The
Boston Public Library, that magnificent institution,
which has done so much to spread "sweetness and
light," to use Matthew Arnolds' celebrated definition
of culture, among the people of the "Hub," counts
Mr. Ticknor among the most generous of its benefactors.</p>
<p>One interesting spot for the historical pilgrim is the
oldest inn in Boston, the "Hancock House," near
Faneuil Hall, which sheltered Talleyrand and Louis
Philippe during the French reign of terror.</p>
<p>In addition to the fever for improvement, Boston
owes the loss of many of her time-hallowed buildings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to a more disastrous agency—that of the conflagrations
which have visited her with strange frequency.
A fire in 1811, which swept away the little house on
Milk street where Franklin was born—and which is
now occupied by the Boston <i>Post</i>—another in 1874, in
which more than one hundred buildings were destroyed;
and the "Great Boston Fire" of 1872, followed
by conflagrations in 1873, 1874, 1877 and 1878,
seemed to indicate that the fire fiend had selected
Boston as his especial prey. To the terrible fire of
1872 many precious lives, property valued at eighty
millions of dollars, and the entire section of the city
enclosed by Summer, Washington, Milk and Broad
streets were sacrificed. The scene was one a witness
never could forget. Mingled with the alarum of the
fire-bells and the screams and shouts of a fear-stricken
people came the sound of terrific explosions, those of
the buildings which were blown up in the hope of
thus "starving out" the fire by making gaps which
it could not overstep, and to still further complete the
desolation, the gas was shut off, leaving the city in
a horror of darkness; but the flames swept on like a
pursuing Fury, wrapping the doomed city still closer
in her embrace of death, and who was not satisfied until
she had left the business centre of Boston a charred
and blackened ruin.</p>
<p>This same district is to-day, however, the most prosperous
and architecturally prepossessing of the business
sections of the city, practically illustrating another
phase of that same spirit of improvement and civic
pride which has overturned so many ancient idols and
to-day threatens others. Indeed, it would be a churlish
disposition which would lament the disappearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of the old edifices, the straightening of the thoroughfares,
the alterations without number which have
taken place, and which have resulted in the Boston
of to-day, one of the most beautiful, prosperous
and public-spirited cities in the world. The intelligence
and local loyalty, for which her citizens are
renowned, have been set to work to attain one object—the
modest goal of perfection. Obstacles which
some cities might have contentedly accepted as unavoidable
have been swept away; advantages with
which other cities might have been satisfied have
been still further extended and improved. The 783
acres originally purchased by the settlers of Boston
from William Blaxton for £30 has been increased
over thirty times, until the city limits comprise
23,661 acres; this not by magic as it would seem,
but by annexation of adjoining boroughs—Roxbury,
Dorchester, Charlestown, and others—and by reclamation
of the seemingly hopeless marshy land to the
north and south of the city. The "Back-Bay" district,
the very centre of Boston's wealth, fashion and refinement,
the handsomest residence quarter in
America, is built upon this "made land," which it
cost the city about $1,750,000 to fill in and otherwise
render solid.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 269px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption1">
<img alt="SCENES IN BOSTON." height="450" src="images/illus-039.png" title="SCENES IN BOSTON" width="269" id="id-2879470008198448661">
<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption1">SCENES IN BOSTON.</span>
</div>
<p>All good Bostonians, like the rest of their countrymen,
may wish to go to Paris when they die—that point
cannot be settled; but it is certain that they all wish to
go to the Back-Bay while they live. And who can
wonder? To drive at night down Commonwealth
avenue, the most aristocratic street in this aristocratic
quarter, is to view a scene from fairyland. "The
Avenue" itself is 250 feet wide from house to house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and 175 feet wide from curb to curb, and in the centre
a picturesque strip of parkland, adorned with statues
and bordered with ornamental trees and shrubs,
follows its entire length. On either side of the street
stand palatial hotels and magnificent private residences,
from whose innumerable windows twinkle innumerable
lights, which, mingling with the quadruple
row of gas-lamps which look like a winding ribbon of
light, make the vista perfectly dazzling in its beauty.
By day, when the Back Bay Park, the Public Garden,
the fine bridge over the park water-way extension and
the handsome surrounding and intersecting streets can
be seen, the view is even more attractive.</p>
<p>In the newer parts of Boston the reproach of
crooked streets, which has given her sister cities opportunity
for so much good-natured "chaff," is removed,
and the thoroughfares are laid out with such precision
that "the wayfaring man, though a fool," can hardly
"err therein." In the business district much money
has been spent on the straightening process, a fact
whose knowledge prompts the bewildered stranger to
exclaim, "Were they ever worse than this?" Stories
aimed at this little peculiarity of the "Hub" are innumerable,
the visitor being told with perfect gravity that
if he follows a street in a straight line he will find
himself at his original starting-point—a statement the
writer's experience can pretty nearly verify. The best,
if not the most credible, of these tales relates how a
puzzled pedestrian, becoming "mixed up in his tracks,"
endeavored to overtake a man who was walking ahead
of him, and inquire his way. The faster he walked,
however, the faster the other man walked, until it
became a regular chase, and the now thoroughly confused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
stranger had but one idea—to catch his fellow-pedestrian
by the coat-tails, if need be, and demand to
be set on his homeward way. Finally, by making a
frantic forward lurch, he succeeded—and discovered
that the coat-tails he was grasping were his own!</p>
<p>The true Bostonian is secretly rather proud, however,
of this distinguished trait of his beloved city, and
is willing to go "all around Robin Hood's barn" to
get to his destination.</p>
<p>But the thing of which the Bostonian is proudest of
all is his famous Common, whose green turf and noble
shade-trees have formed a stage and background for so
many of the most exciting scenes of Colonial and
Revolutionary history. Among the troops which have
been mustered and drilled upon it were a portion of the
forces which captured Quebec and Louisburg; and the
rehearsals for the grim drama of war, which later was
partly performed on the same ground by red-coat and
continental, took place here. It was at the Common's
foot that the hated "lobster-backs" assembled before embarking
for Lexington; on the Common that they
marshalled their forces for the conflict at Bunker Hill.
It has been covered with white tents during the British
occupation of Boston; dotted with earthworks behind
which the enemy crouched, expecting an attack by
Washington upon their stronghold. It was on Boston
Common that the school-boys constructed their snowmen,
whose destruction by the insolent red-coats sent
an indignant deputation of young Bostonians to complain
to General Gage, who, stunned by what the
young Bostonian of to-day would designate as "the
cheek of the thing," promised them redress, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
exclaimed, "These boys seem to take in the love of
liberty with the very air they breathe."</p>
<p>There are other interesting historical incidents,
recorded in connection with the Common, but space
forbids their narration. I would rather describe it as
it first appeared to me, a beautiful surprise, a gracious
spot of greenness and of silvery waters and splendid
shade-trees, in the heart of the busy brick-bound city.
Here the children play and coast, as they did in the
days of General Gage; here the lovers walk, on the
five beautiful broad pathways, the Tremont street,
Park street, Beacon street, Charles street and Boylston
street malls. Here the invalids and old folks rest on
the numerous benches; here the people congregate on
summer evenings to enjoy the free open-air concerts,
which are given from the band-stand. "Frog Pond,"
a pretty lakelet, near Flagstaff Hill, and a fine deer-park
in the vicinity of the Boylston street mall, are
great attractions. The Common covers forty-eight
acres, with 1000 stately old shade-trees, and the iron
fence by which it is inclosed measures 5932 feet.</p>
<p>In addition to its natural beauties, the Common has
two fine pieces of statuary, the Soldiers' and Sailors'
Monument on Flagstaff Hill, and the Brener Fountain.
The former was erected in 1871 at a cost of $75,000.
It is a majestic granite shaft in the Roman-Doric style,
seventy feet high, surmounted by a bronze figure of the
Genius of America, eleven feet in height. At the base of
the shaft are grouped alto-relievo figures representing
the North, the South, the East, and the West. Four
other bronze figures, representing Peace, History, the
Army and the Navy, stand on projecting pedestals
around the foundation. The monument, which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
executed by Martin Milmore, was Boston's tribute to
her fallen heroes of the Civil War. The Brener
Fountain is a beautiful bronze casting designed by
Lienard, of Paris, with bronze figures representing
Neptune, Amphitrite, Acis, and Galatea grouped round
the base. The late Gardner Brener presented it to the
city in 1868.</p>
<p>To forget the Old Elm in describing the Common,
would be rank disrespect to that hoary "oldest inhabitant,"
albeit nothing remains of it now but its memory.
An iron fence surrounds the spot where once it stood,
and a vigorous young sapling has providentially
sprung up in its place, as a successor. The Old Elm
was ancient in 1630, when the town was settled, and
was one of its most interesting landmarks up to 1876,
when it was blown down.</p>
<p>The Public Garden, from which the beautiful Commonwealth
avenue begins, the Back-Bay Park, which
cost a million of dollars, and the Arnold Arboretum,
where Harvard University has planted and maintained
a fine horticultural collection for the pleasure of the
public, are lovely spots on whose beauty the mind would
fain linger, but whose descriptions must be omitted, for
all Boston's splendid public buildings wait in stately
array their share of attention. Nowhere has the
skilled artist-architect been so freely permitted to carry
out his designs unhampered by stupidity and stinginess
as in Boston, and the result has been a collection of
public buildings unsurpassed by those of any modern
city. The Boston State House comes first, of course—did
not the "Autocrat of the Breakfast Table" term it,
with loving exaggeration, the "Hub of the Solar
System?" From Beacon Hill, the most prominent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
coign of vantage which could be selected for it, its
gilded dome rises majestically against the blue sky and
imperiously beckons the visitor to come and pay his
respects to this most venerated of Boston institutions.
The State House stands, at a height of 110 feet, at the
junction of Beacon and Mt. Vernon streets and Hancock
avenue, on a lot which Governor Hancock once
used for pasturing his cows, and was erected in 1795,
beginning its existence in a blaze of glory, with the
corner-stone laid by Paul Revere, then Grand Master
of the Masons, and an oration by Samuel Adams.
The building contains Doric Hall, which is approached
by a fine series of stone terraces from Beacon street;
Hall of Representatives, the Senate Chamber, the
Government Room, and the State Library.</p>
<p>It abounds in relics, among which are the tattered
shreds of flags brought back by Massachusetts soldiers
from Southern battle-fields—a sight which must stir
every loyal heart, to whatsoever State it owes allegiance;
the guns carried by the Concord minute-men in
the Revolutionary conflict; and duplicates of the gift to
the State by Charles Sumner, of the memorial tablets
of the Washington family in England. Doric Hall
contains busts of Sumner, Adams, Lincoln, and other
great men, and several fine statues—one of Washington,
by Chantrey, and one by Thomas Ball; a speaking
likeness in marble of John A. Andrew, the indomitable
old War Governor of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>On the handsome terraces in front of the building
stand two superb bronzes, one is the Horace Mann
statue, by Emma Stebbins, which was erected in 1865,
and paid for by contributions from teachers and school
children all over Massachusetts; the other Hiram Powers'<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
statue of Daniel Webster, which cost $10,000. It was
erected in 1859, and was the second statue of Webster
which the famous sculptor wrought, the first, the product
of so much toil and pains and the embodiment of
so much genius, having been lost at sea.</p>
<p>Last, but very far from least in importance, may be
mentioned the historic codfish, which hangs from the
ceiling of Assembly Hall, dangling before the eyes of
the legislators in perpetual reminder of the source of
Massachusetts' present greatness, for the codfish might
by a stretch of Hibernian rhetoric be described as the
patron saint of the Bay State.</p>
<p>I must confess to having been one of the 50,000
curious ones who, it is computed, annually ascend into
the gilded cupola and "view the landscape o'er." The
spectacle unrolled panorama-like before the sight is
indeed a feast to the eyes.</p>
<p>The Old State House of 1748, built on the site of
Boston's earliest town hall, is now used as a historical
museum under the auspices of the Bostonian Society.
Careful restoration has perpetuated many of the old
associations which hallow the ancient fane, sacred to
loyalty and to liberty. The old council-chambers have
been given much of their original appearance, and the
great carving of the Lion and the Unicorn, which
savored of offence to patriotic nostrils and so was taken
down from its gables in Revolutionary times, has been
replaced. To visit this building is a liberal education
in local history.</p>
<p>The Boston Post Office, of whose migrations I have
spoken earlier, is now settled for good and all in a
magnificent structure of Cape Ann granite, built in
Renaissance style, whose corner-stone was laid in 1871<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and which was just ready for the addition of the roof
when the Great Fire of 1872 descended upon it and beat
upon it so fiercely that even to-day the traces of the
intense heat are visible on parts of the edifice.
Damage to the amount of $175,000 was done. The
Sub-Treasury, the United States courts, the pension and
internal revenue offices are domiciled here, and it is
considered the handsomest public building in all New
England, having cost $6,000,000. The interior furnishings
are sumptuous in the extreme, the doors and
windows in the Sub-Treasury apartments being of solid
mahogany, beautifully polished. The "marble cash-room"
is a splendid hall, decorated in Greek style, with
wall-slabbing of dark and light shades of Sienna marble
and graceful pilasters of Sicilian marble.</p>
<p>The City Hall, on School street, is the seat of the
municipal housekeeping. Here the departments of
streets, water, lighting, police, and public printing
have their offices, and Common Council sits in august
assemblage. It is a commanding structure of granite,
fireproof, and in the Renaissance style. Its cost was
$500,000. Two fine bronze statues, one by Greenough,
of Franklin, one by Ball, of Josiah Quincy, ornament
the grassy square in front of the building.</p>
<p>No picture of Boston would be complete without
that old landmark, Tremont Temple. It occupies
the former site of the Tremont Theatre and contains
one of the largest halls in the city. The building itself,
however, sinks into insignificance before the crowd
of associations that stir the blood at its very name.
For years it has been the rallying point of Boston's
most notable gatherings—political, intellectual, and
religious. If, instead of colorless words, we could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
photograph upon this page the pictures those old walls
have looked upon, we might revel in a gallery of
famous portraits such as the world has rarely seen.
Edward Everett, Wendell Phillips, William Lloyd
Garrison, Joseph Cook, Phillips Brooks, and other
master-spirits of the age, would be there. And there,
too, would be a sprinkling of that other sex, no longer
handicapped by the epithet "gentler."</p>
<p>But, could we press the phonograph as well as the
camera into our service, and hear again the thunders
of stormy oratory, the clash of political warfare, and
the pleading tenderness of religious eloquence that has
often resounded under that old roof, then indeed we
might well forget the world of to-day in the fascination
of this drama of the past.</p>
<p>Architecturally, Boston combines in the happiest
way all that is beautiful and dignified in the classic
models and all that is fresh and original in modern
canons of building. A magnificent group of buildings,
in the vicinity of Boylston and Huntingdon streets
and Copley Square, fairly takes the breath away with
its beauty. Trinity Church and the Museum of Fine
Arts, the "New Old South Church" and the new
Boston Public Library, form such a quartet of splendid
edifices as even the travelled eye seldom sees.
The Public Library is an embodied Triumph—the
symbol of that great heritage of culture which the city
pours out on her denizens as lavishly and as freely as
water, and which, like "the gentle dew from heaven,
blesseth him that gives and him that takes," returning
to enrich the community with its diffused presence,
like the showers which return to the bosom of the river,
the moisture the sun only borrowed for a space.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a></span>
Bostonians have always been proud of their Public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Library, from its foundation in 1852. By 1885, the
Boylston street building, with accommodations for
250,000 volumes, was too contracted a space to hold the
largest public library in the world, and with characteristic
promptness the city rose to the occasion and embodied
its thought that "nothing can be too good for
the people" in the beautiful new library in Copley
Square, which cost the royal sum of $2,600,000.</p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption2">BOSTON AND ENVIRONS.</span>
</div>
<p>The long chapter of description which this splendid
enterprise merits must be reluctantly crowded into a
few lines. Nothing, however, save personal observation,
can give an adequate perception of its outward
loveliness; its exterior of soft cream-gray granite, with
a succession of noble arched windows ranged along its
fine façades; its arches, pillars and floorings of rare
marbles, and its mosaics, panels and carvings. The grand
staircase of splendid Sienna marble, opposite the main
entrance, is one of the finest in the world; and scholar
or philosopher could ask no more attractive spot for
thoughtful promenade than the beautiful open court,
with its marble basin and MacMonnies fountain in the
centre, the soft green of its surrounding turf affording
grateful rest to book-wearied eyes, and the pensive beauty
of the cloister-like colonnade forming an ideal retreat.</p>
<p>The foremost artists of the world are represented in
the interior decoration. The famous St. Gaudens seal,
designed by Kenyon Cox and executed by Augustus
St. Gaudens, ornaments the central arch of the main
vestibule; the bronze doors are by Daniel G. French;
the splendid marble lions in the staircase hall—erected
as memorials to their martyred comrades by two regiments
of Massachusetts volunteers—are by Louis St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Gaudens; and Puvis de Chavannes, James McNeil
Whistler, Edwin A. Abbey and John S. Sargent are
among the celebrated artists who have contributed to
the mural decorations, friezes and ceiling frescoes.</p>
<p>Six hundred and fifty thousand volumes at present
constitute the stock of the library—a vast treasure-house
of information, instruction and pleasure to
which any citizen of Boston can have access by simply
registering his name, and which among other valuable
special collections includes the Brown musical library
of 12,000 volumes and rare autograph manuscripts;
the Barton Shaksperian library, one of the finest collections
of Shakesperiana extant, valued at $250,000;
the Bowditch mathematical library and the splendid
Chamberlain collection of autographs, which is worth
$60,000 and represents a lifetime of work on the part
of the donor. The wonderful pneumatic and electric
system of tubes and railways which connects the delivery
and stackrooms and keeps this vast collection of books,
pamphlets and magazines in circulation, smacks almost
of the conjurer's craft. Whatever else must be
crowded out of a visit to Boston, the Public Library
assuredly should not be passed by.</p>
<p>Trinity Church stands within hailing distance of
the Public Library, on Boylston and Clarendon streets—an
imposing and beautiful edifice of granite and
freestone, built in French Romanesque style, with a
tower 211 feet high. Far outside of Boston has the
fame of Trinity Church penetrated, owing not to the
fact that it is one of the most splendid, costly and
fashionable churches in the country, but to its ever-revered
and ever-mourned rector, the late Phillips
Brooks, Bishop of Massachusetts, whose massive figure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
will stand out against the horizon for many a year as
the most striking speaker and deeply spiritual thinker
America has ever known.</p>
<p>From Copley Square, not far from Trinity, rise the
spires of the "New Old South" Church, a superb
structure in North Italian Gothic style, rich in
beautiful stone-work, carvings and stained glass. It
was erected at a cost of over half a million of dollars
to take the place of the disused "Old South" on
Washington street. Another prominent church is the
First Church, at Marlborough and Berkeley streets,
the lineal descendant of the humble little mud-walled
meeting-house which was the first consecrated roof
under which the good folk of Boston gathered for divine
worship. The congregation of that day could
scarce believe their sober Puritan eyes could they behold
the $325,000 church which was built in 1868 to
continue the succession which had begun with the
little mud meeting-house of 1632.</p>
<p>King's Chapel, with its ancient burying-ground, is
one of the most famous churches in Boston, having
been the chapel of the royal governor, officers of the
army and navy, and other official representatives of
the "principalities and powers" of the mother country.
Massive, almost sombre, in its exterior, and
quaint and picturesque within, the old church stands,
with few changes, as erected in 1749, with its old-fashioned
pulpit and sounding-board, prim, straight pillars,
and antique high-backed pews which recall the remark
of the little girl, that when she went to church she
"went into a cupboard and climbed up on the shelf."
Its burying-ground is believed to be the oldest in the
city. Christ Church, built in 1723, is the oldest church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
edifice in the city. Its age-mellowed chime of bells
was the first ever brought into this country, and the
first American Sunday-school was established there in
1816. To-day its tall steeple, which on the eve of
Lexington's conflict bore the signal lanterns of Paul
Revere, is the most conspicuous object in the North
End, where the old-time aristocrats who worshipped
in Christ Church have given place to a poverty-stricken
foreign population to whom the church is little and its
traditions less. Churches which well deserve more
extended mention, could space permit, are the beautiful
Gothic Cathedral of the Holy Cross, with its fine
organ and splendid high-altar of onyx and marble;
Tremont Temple, whose hall is the largest in Boston;
and the South Congregational Church, presided over
by Rev. Edward Everett Hale, author of "The
Man without a Country" and other world-famous
literary productions, and originator of the equally
famous "Ten Times One" clubs.</p>
<p>Boston's religious history is most interesting, although
almost kaleidoscopic in its changes. From being the
stronghold of Puritan orthodoxy it has become the
headquarters of liberal Unitarianism. King's Chapel
is a curious instance; originally an Episcopal church
and congregation, it became Unitarian in 1787, retaining
the Episcopal liturgy with necessary changes, and
now doctrines are preached over the tombs of the dead
dignitaries interred beneath the church floor, diametrically
opposed to those in which they lived, died and
were buried. Though all denominations of course
flourish within her walls, Boston is still strongly Congregational
in her leanings.</p>
<p>From the churches to the schools is a natural transition.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
The founders of Boston's greatness placed the
two influences side by side in importance, and their
wisdom in doing so has had its justification. The
current "poking of fun" at the "Boston school-ma'am,"
her glasses, her learning and her devotion to Browning;
and the Boston infant, who converses in polysyllables
almost from his birth, has its foundation in the
fact, everywhere admitted, that nowhere are intelligence
and culture so widely diffused in all ranks of
life as in Boston. The free-school system, an experiment
which she was the first American city to inaugurate,
is considered by educators to lead the world. The
city's annual expenditures for her public schools, of
which there are over 500, amount to about $2,000,000,
and from the kindergarten to the High School, where
the pupils can be prepared for college, the youth of
the city are carefully watched, trained, instructed, and
all that is best in them drawn out. Even in summer,
"vacation schools" are held, where the children who
would otherwise be running wild in the streets can
learn sewing, box-making, cooking and other useful
branches.</p>
<p>The English High and Latin School is the largest
free public school building in the world, being 423
feet long by 220 feet wide. It is a fine structure in
Renaissance style, with every advantage and improvement
looking to health and convenience that even the
progressive Boston mind could think of. It would be
a sluggish soul indeed that would not be thrilled by
the sight of the entire school-battalion going through
its exercises in the immense drill-room, and realize the
hopeful future for this vast army of coming citizens,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
who are thus early and thus admirably taught the
priceless lesson of discipline.</p>
<p>The Boston Normal School, the Girls' High School
and the Public Latin School for girls, fully cover the
demand for the higher education of women. The
latter institution is the fruit of the efforts of the
Society for the University Education of Women, and
its graduates enter the female colleges with ease.
Wellesley, the "College Beautiful," as its students have
fondly christened it, is situated close to Boston in the
beautiful village of Wellesley, where feminine education
is conducted almost on ideal lines. No woman's
college in the world has so many students, or so beautiful
a home in which to shelter the fair heads, inwardly
crammed and running over with knowledge,
and outwardly adorned, either in fact or in prospective,
with the scholastic cap of learning. Since its opening
in 1875, Wellesley has almost created a new era in
woman's education, and its curriculum is the same as
those of the most advanced male colleges. The College
Aid Society, which at an annual cost of from
$6000 to $7000 helps ambitious girlhood, for whom
straitened means would otherwise render a university
education impossible, is an interesting feature of the
college.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption3">

</div>
<p>What Wellesley has for twenty years been to American
girlhood, Harvard University has for 150 years
been to American young manhood, and though its chief
departments are located at Cambridge, it may still be
fairly ranked with Bostonian institutions. The tie
which connects the Cambridge University and the
capital of Massachusetts is closer than that existing
between mere neighbors—it is a veritable bond of kinship.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
It might be said that from the opening of the
University in 1638, Boston made Harvard and Harvard
Boston. Its illustrious founder, John Harvard,
was a resident of Charlestown, now a part of Boston—and
his monument, erected by subscriptions of Harvard
graduates, is one of the principal "sights" of that district,
where it stands near the Old State Prison. To its
classic groves Boston has sent, and from them received
again, the noblest of her sons; and three of her departments,
the Bussey Institution of Agriculture, the
Medical School and the Dental School, are situated
within the limits of Boston proper. Harvard University
at present owns property valued at $6,000,000,
and accommodates nearly 2000 pupils. In addition
to the departments already mentioned and which are
located in Boston, the principal sections are Harvard
College, the Jefferson Laboratory, the Lawrence
Scientific School, the new Law School, the Divinity
School, the Harvard Library, Botanical Gardens,
Observatory, Museum of Comparative Zoölogy, Peabody
Museum of Archæology and Ethnology, Agassiz
Museum, Hemenway Gymnasium and Memorial Hall.
To wander through its ancient halls, the oldest of
which dates back to 1720, and which have been used
by Congress, is to visit the cradle of university education
in America.</p>
<p>Boston University, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, one of the best scientific colleges on the
continent, Tufts College and the celebrated Chauncy
Hall School, are among the finest of Boston's many
admirable educational institutions.</p>
<p>Mention has been made of the Harvard Monument,
but not of the others among the scores of fine examples<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of the sculptor's art which are scattered throughout
the city in generous profusion for the delight and the
education of the public eye. The famous Bunker Hill
Monument was naturally one of the first objects sought
out by the writer on the occasion of his first visit to
Boston. This splendid shaft of granite was dedicated
to the fallen patriots of Bunker Hill in 1841, the
corner-stone having been laid in 1825 by General
Lafayette—Daniel Webster delivering the orations
on both occasions. Its site, on Monument Square,
Breed's Hill, is the spot where the Americans threw
up the redoubt on the night before the memorable
battle, and a tablet at its foot marks the place where
the illustrious Warren fell.</p>
<p>The monument is 221-1/6 feet high—a fact fully realized
only by climbing the 259 steps of the spiral staircase
of stone in the interior of the shaft which leads
to a small chamber near the apex, from which four
windows look out upon the surrounding country—a
superb vista. The cost of this monument was
$150,000.</p>
<p>In the Public Gardens, in the Back Bay district,
across from Commonwealth avenue, may be seen one
of the largest pieces of statuary in America, and, according
to some connoisseurs, the handsomest in Boston.
This is Ball's huge statue of Washington, which
measures twenty-two feet in height. The statue was
unveiled in 1869, and it is said that not a stroke of
work was laid upon it by any hand of artisan or artist
outside of Massachusetts. The Beacon street side of
the Public Gardens contains another famous statue—that
of Edward Everett, by W. W. Story. Other
great citizens whose memory has been perpetuated in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
life-like marble are Samuel Adams, William Lloyd
Garrison and Colonel William Prescott. The Emancipation
Group is a duplicate of the "Freedman's Memorial"
statue in Washington. The soldiers' monuments
in Dorchester, Charlestown, Roxbury, West
Roxbury and Brighton commemorate the unnamed,
uncounted, but not unhonored dead who laid down
their lives on the battlefields of the Civil War.</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The bravely dumb who did their deed,<br></span>
<span class="i1">And scorned to blot it with a name;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Men of the plain, heroic breed,</span><br>
<span class="i1">Who loved Heaven's silence more than fame."</span><br>
</div></div>
<p>An interesting object is the Ether Monument on
the Arlington street side of the Public Gardens erected
in recognition of the fact that it was in the Massachusetts
General Hospital—in the face of terrible
opposition and coldness and discouragement, as history
tells us, though the marble does not—that Dr. Sims
first gave the world his wonderful discovery of the
power of ether to cause insensibility to pain.</p>
<p>That there should be so many of these fine pieces
in Boston's parks and public places is matter for congratulation
but scarcely for surprise. As a patron of
music, literature, art and all the external graces of
civilization she has so long and so easily held her supremacy
that one is half inclined to believe that at
least a delegation of the Muses, if not the whole
sisterhood, had exchanged the lonely and unappreciated
grandeur of Parnassus for a seat on one of
Boston's three hills. The Handel and Haydn Society,
the oldest musical society in the United States; the
Harvard Musical Association; the famous Boston<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Symphony Orchestra and the Orpheus Club, speak—and
right musically—of Boston's love for the art of
which Cecilia was patron saint. Music Hall, an immense
edifice near Tremont street, is the home of
music in Boston. Here the symphony concerts are
held weekly, and here all the musical "stars" whose
orbit includes Boston make their first appearance before
a critical "Hub" audience. Its great organ, with
over 5,000 pipes, is one of the largest ever made.</p>
<p>The idea of a national university of music—sneered
at and scouted when a few enthusiasts first talked and
dreamed of it—took shape in 1867 in the now famous
New England Conservatory of Music, founded by
Eben Tourjée. It is a magnificent school in a magnificent
home—the old St. James' Hotel on Franklin
Square—with a hundred teachers from the very foremost
rank of their profession. The conservatory has
possibly done more for New England culture than
any other influence save Harvard University.</p>
<p>The literary life of Boston needs neither chronicler
nor comment. Such men as Thomas Bailey Aldrich,
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Francis Parkman, Prescott,
the historian, Longfellow, Lowell and countless others
who, living, have made the city their home, or, dead,
sleep in its chambers of Peace, have cast a glamour of
books and bookmen and book-life around her until
her title of "The Athens of America" has passed from
jest to earnest. The earliest newspaper in America
was the Boston <i>News Letter</i>; and to-day its many
newspapers maintain the highest standard of "up-to-date"
journalism in the dignified, not the degrading
sense of the word. Boston is indeed a "bookworm's
paradise," with its splendid free lending library and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
low-priced book-stores, making access to the best
authors possible to the poorest. The <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>,
which for so many years has occupied a place unique
and unapproachable among American magazines, is
published here.</p>
<p>Art is represented by the magnificent Museum of
Fine Arts, with its beautiful exterior and interior
decorations and fine collection of antiques and art objects;
the Art Club, the Sketch and the Paint and
Clay clubs, as well as by the innumerable paintings
and statues appearing in public places; by the Athenæum,
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
the Boston Society of Natural History, the Warren
Museum and the Lowell Institute free lectures.</p>
<p>To draw this brief study of Boston to a close
without mentioning her countless charities would be a
grave omission, since these form so large a part of the
city's life and activities. As is always the case in
great towns, two hands are ever outstretched—that of
Lazarus, pleading, demanding, and that of Dives—more
unselfish now than in the days of the parable—giving
again and yet again. Boston's philanthropists
flatter themselves that <i>there</i> the giving is rather more
judicious, as well as generous, than is frequently the
case; and that "the pauperizing of the poor," that
consummation devoutly to be avoided, is a minimized
danger. The "Central Charity Bureau" and the
"Associated Charities" systematize the work of relief,
prevent imposture and duplication of charity, and do
an invaluable service to the different organizations.
Private subscriptions of citizens maintain the work,
which is carried on in three fine buildings of brick
and stone on Chardon street, one of which is used as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
temporary home for destitute women and children.
The Massachusetts General Hospital—which, save for
the Pennsylvania Hospital, is the oldest in the country—the
Boston City Hospital, the New England Hospital
for Women and Children, and a number of other
finely-organized institutions care efficiently for the
city's sick and suffering. Orphan asylums, reform
schools, missions of various sorts, and retreats for the
aged and indigent, are numerous.</p>
<p>One of the most unique and interesting among
these charities is "The Children's Mission to the
Children of the Destitute," which aims to bring the
little ones of these two sadly separated classes, the
poor and the well-to-do, in contact for their mutual
benefit. By its agency the forlorn little waifs of the
streets are provided with home and friends, religious
and secular instruction, and employment whenever
necessary or advisable. Still more unique is the
Massachusetts Charitable Mechanics' Association,
whose vast building and hall on Huntingdon avenue
occupies an area of over 110,000 square feet. As
early as 1795 this association was founded to extend a
helping hand to mechanics in difficulties, to establish
libraries and classes for apprentices, offer premiums
for inventions and improvements in trades, and give
every encouragement to the tradesman. The building
is a beautiful as well as a vast structure, and eight
thousand people can be seated in the grand hall. The
mechanics' festivals, fairs, and exhibitions of industry
are held here from time to time, when there is
much awarding of medals, prizes and honors.</p>
<p>On Boston's commercial greatness there is no space
to touch. Nor is it needed. Could her schools, her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
churches, her charities, her institutions, public and
private, which have here been outlined, flourish without
the backbone of Puritan thrift and the framework
of prosperity which have made her one of the wealthiest
of cities? The solid business foundation is apparent
to all who visit her teeming marts and exchanges.
But the "power behind the throne" is kept with rare
judgment in the background; and when the visitor
comes to kiss the hand of the "Queen of the Commonwealth"
he sees only her chosen handmaids—Ambition,
Culture, Philanthropy, Religion. On these,
finally, she rests her claims to greatness.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>LECTURE AT TREMONT TEMPLE.</h3>
<p>Lecturing in the towns I purposed
visiting was an after consideration of
secondary importance—a sort of adjunct
to the journey and the objects I had
in view. It was thought that it might
afford some facilities for meeting large
numbers of people face to face in the
different sections of the country through
which I designed to pass, and thus
enable me the better to learn something of their social
customs, industries and general progress in the arts
of civilization.</p>
<p>The subject decided upon for the lecture was
"Echoes from the Revolution," and was intended to
be in keeping with the spirit of the Centennial year.
The fact that I had been a cavalryman during the
War of the Rebellion and the novelty of an equestrian
journey of such magnitude would, I estimated, very
naturally awaken considerable interest and a desire
on the part of many to hear what I had to say of the
heroes of "76."</p>
<p>My lecture was a retrospective view of the leading
incidents of the Revolution, with especial reference to
some of the sturdy heroes and stirring scenes of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
most eventful period in American History. Briefly
referring to the causes which led up to the war, I
started with the Ride of Paul Revere from Boston
the night before the Battle of Lexington, and closed
with the Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown.</p>
<p>It was not my wish or intention to derive any pecuniary
benefit from my lectures; but being a member
of the Grand Army of the Republic, and thoroughly
in sympathy with the aims and benevolent projects of
my soldier friends, it was proposed to donate the proceeds
to the Relief Fund of that patriotic organization.</p>
<p>Fully equipped, the weather favorable and roads in
good condition, I was anxious to begin my journey
early in May. It was therefore arranged, as previously
suggested, that I should lecture at Tremont Temple on
the evening of May eighth under the auspices and for
the benefit of the G. A. R. Relief Fund.</p>
<p>The subjoined fraternal and highly complimentary
letter of introduction from Captain Frank M. Clark
of New York was received by the committee of arrangements
soon after my arrival in Boston.</p>
<blockquote><div>

<i>New York, April 20, 1876</i>.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">To Comrades of the G. A. R.</span>:
</p>
<p>I have been intimately acquainted with Captain Willard Glazier,
a comrade in good standing of Post No. 29, Department of New
York, Grand Army of the Republic, for the past eight years, and
know him to be worthy the confidence of every loyal man. He is
an intelligent and courteous gentleman, an author of good repute, a
soldier whose record is without a stain, and a true comrade of the
"Grand Army." I bespeak for him the earnest and cordial support
of all comrades of the Order.</p>
<div class="signature3">Yours very truly in F., C. and L.,</div>
<div class="signature2"><span class="smcap">Frank M. Clark,</span></div>
<div class="signature">Late A. A. G. Department of New York, G. A. R.</div>
</div></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>I may add that, as this was the first occasion of any
importance on which I had been expected to appear before
a public assemblage, I was strongly recommended
to deliver my initial lecture before a smaller and
less critical audience than I was likely to confront in
Boston, and thus prepare myself for a later appearance
in the literary capital; but I reasoned from the standpoint
of a soldier that, as lecturing was a new experience
to me, my military training dictated that if I
could carry the strongest position in the line I need
have but little, if any, concern for the weaker ones, and
hence resolved to deliver my first lecture at Tremont
Temple. I was introduced by Captain Theodore L.
Kelly, commander of Post 15, Department of Massachusetts,
G. A. R., and was honored by the presence
on the platform of representatives from nearly all of
the Posts of Boston and adjacent cities. In presenting
me to my audience Captain Kelly spoke in the following
terms:</p>
<blockquote><div><p>"<span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>: It gives me pleasure to have
the honor of introducing to you one who, by his services
in the field and by the works of his pen, is entitled to your
consideration, and the confidence of all comrades of the
'Grand Army of the Republic.' I desire to say that he
comes well accredited, furnished with the proper vouchers and
documents, and highly endorsed and recommended by the
officers of the Department of the State of New York.
Though young in years, his life has been one of varied and
exciting experience. Born in the wilds of St. Lawrence
County, New York, his education was drawn from the great
book of Nature; and from his surroundings he early imbibed
a love of liberty. His early associations naturally invested
him with a fondness for adventure and excitement and when
the call of war was heard he at once responded, and enlisted in
the Harris Light Cavalry, with which corps he passed through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
many exciting scenes of march and fray. His experience
amid the various vicissitudes of the war, in camp and field
and prison, have been vividly portrayed by his pen in his
various publications. Still inspired by this love of adventure,
he proposes to undertake the novelty of a journey across the
Continent in the saddle. His objects are manifold. While
visiting scenes and becoming more familiar with his own
country, he will collect facts and information for a new book,
and at his various stopping-places he will lecture under the
auspices and for the benefit of the 'Grand Army of the
Republic,' to whose fraternal regard he is most warmly commended.
Allow me then, ladies and gentlemen, without
further ceremony, to present to you the Soldier-Author, and
our comrade, Willard Glazier."</p></div></blockquote>
<p>I was much gratified on the morning of the ninth
to find commendatory reference to my lecture in the
leading journals of Boston, for I will frankly admit
that I had had some misgivings as to the verdict of the
critics, and rather expected to be "handled without
gloves" in some of the first cities on the programme.
Of the dailies which came to my notice the <i>Globe</i>
said:—</p>
<blockquote><div><p>"A very fair audience considering the unfair condition of the
elements, was gathered in Tremont Temple last night to hear Captain
Willard Glazier's lecture upon 'Echoes from the Revolution.'
The frequent applause of the audience evinced not only a sympathy
with the subject, but an evident liking of the manner in which
it was delivered. The lecture itself was a retrospective view of the
leading incidents of the Revolution. It would have been unfair to
expect to hear anything very new upon a subject with which the
veriest school-boy is familiar; but Captain Glazier wove the events
together in a manner which freed the lecture from that most
unpardonable of all faults, which can be committed upon the platform—dulness.
He passed over, in his consideration of the Revolution,
the old scenes up to the time when Cornwallis surrendered
up his sword and command to George Washington. 'The year
1876,' said Captain Glazier, 're-echoes the scenes and events of a
hundred years ago. In imagination we make a pilgrimage back to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the Revolution. We visit the fields whereon our ancestors fought
for liberty and a republic. We follow patriots from Lexington to
Yorktown. I see them pushing their way through the ice of the
Delaware—I see them at Saratoga, at Bennington, at Princeton,
and at Monmouth. I follow Marion and his daring troopers
through the swamps of Georgia and the Carolinas;' and in following
them up, the lecturer interspersed his exciting narrative with
sundry droll episodes. Treating of the battles of Trenton and
Princeton, he expatiated upon the devoted heroism of John Stark,
and briefly traced his career until, at Bennington, Burgoyne's
victor announced to his comrades, 'We must conquer to-day, my
boys, or to-night Molly Stark's a widow.' One battle after another
was handled by the lecturer in a pleasing manner, showing that he
was thoroughly familiar with the subject he had chosen for his
theme. After speaking in a most zealous manner of the troops on
land, Captain Glazier remarked: 'Our victories on the ocean during
the war of the Revolution were not less decisive and glorious
than those achieved on land. John Paul Jones and the gallant
tars who, under his leadership, braved the dangers of the deep,
and wrested from proud Britain, once queen of the sea, that illustrious
motto which may be seen high on our banner beside the
stars and stripes.'</p>
<p>"Captain Glazier made special mention of the naval engagement
between the Bon Homme Richard and the British man-of-war
Serapis, which took place in September, 1789. He described in
glowing words the fierce nature of that memorable contest, until
the captain of the Serapis, with his own hand, struck the flag of
England to the free Stars and Stripes of young America. Captain
Glazier has elements in him which, carefully matured and nurtured,
will make him successful on the platform, as he has already
proved himself in the field of literature. He has a strong and
melodious voice, a gentlemanly address, and unassuming confidence.
He was presented to the audience by Commandant Kelly,
of Post 15, Grand Army of the Republic, in a brief but eloquent
speech. Captain Glazier will start on his long ride to San Francisco,
from the Revere House, this morning, at 9.30, and will be
accompanied to Bunker Hill and thence to Brighton, by several
distinguished members of the 'Grand Army,' and other gentlemen,
who wish the Captain success on his long journey from Ocean to
Ocean."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a></span></p></div></blockquote>

<p>The lecture proved a success financially, and in fulfilment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of my purpose I donated the entire proceeds to
the Relief Fund of Posts 7 and 15, as I was largely
indebted to the comrades of these organizations for
the hearty co-operation which insured a full house
at Tremont Temple. The letter below was addressed
to the Assistant Adjutant-General of the Department.</p>
<blockquote><div>

<p>It is only justice to the comrades of Posts 7 and
15 to say that on my arrival in Boston they were
most cordial in their reception, most zealous in their
co-operation with my advance agents and most solicitous
for the success of my journey and its objects. In
short they were true comrades in the best sense of the
term, and my delightful sojourn in their generous and
patriotic city was largely due to their numerous courtesies.</p>

<h3>BOSTON TO ALBANY.</h3>
<h4>First Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>South Framingham House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">South Framingham, Massachusetts</span>,</div>
<div class="signature2"><i>May 9, 1876</i>.</div>
<p>The initial step in my journey from
Ocean to Ocean was taken at ten o'clock
on the morning of the above date when
I mounted my horse in front of the
Revere House, Boston, and started for
Worcester, where it had been announced
I would lecture on the following evening.
The Revere House was fixed
upon by comrades of the G. A. R. as
a rendezvous before starting. Here I found a large
gathering of the Order. A rain storm setting in as I
put my foot into the stirrup, hasty adieus were said
to the Boys in Blue and others as I was about riding
away from the "Revere."</p>
<p>I was escorted to Bunker Hill and thence to
Brighton by many comrades and friends, among them
Colonels John F. Finley and E. A. Williston, who
were mounted; and Captain Charles W. Thompson,
adjutant-general Department of Massachusetts; Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Theodore L. Kelly, commander of Post 15;
Grafton Fenno, adjutant, Post 7, G. A. R., and many
others in carriages.</p>
<p>Our route from Boston was by way of Charlestown
and Cambridge to Brighton. A short halt was made
at Bunker Hill. After a hurried look at the Monument
we rode around it and then headed for Brighton.
The rain was now falling in torrents and quickening
our pace we passed rapidly through Cambridge,
glancing hastily at the University Buildings as we
galloped down the main thoroughfare of the city.</p>
<p>Brighton was reached between twelve and one
o'clock. Owing to the storm our short journey to this
place was anything but agreeable and when we dismounted
at the Cattle Fair Hotel all who were not in
covered conveyances were drenched to the skin. Here
the entire party had dinner, after which I took leave
of my friendly escort, who one and all took me by the
hand and wished me Godspeed.</p>
<p>Pushing on through Newton and some smaller
towns and villages I pulled up in front of the South
Framingham House a few minutes after five o'clock
in the evening. My clothing was thoroughly soaked
and my cavalry boots filled to overflowing. Having
secured accommodations for the night, <i>Paul</i> was fed
and groomed; clothing and equipments hung up to
dry and the first day of my long ride from sea to sea
was off the calendar.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a></span></p>

<h4>Second Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Bay State House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Worcester, Massachusetts</span>,</div>
<div class="signature2"><i>May Tenth</i>.</div>
<p>I slept soundly at the South Framingham House
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and was up and out to the hotel stable at an early
hour in the morning. I found <i>Paul Revere</i>, my
equine companion, in good spirits and fancied that the
significant look he gave me was an assurance that he
would be ready for the road when called for.</p>
<p>After a hearty breakfast and a few questions concerning
the beautiful little city in which I had spent
the first night of my journey, I mounted <i>Paul</i> and
rode out towards the Boston and Albany Turnpike.
Being impressed with the appearance and enterprise
of the place, while passing through some of its streets
especial inquiry was made concerning its population,
schools and industries. I learned that South Framingham
is twenty-one miles from Boston, at the junction
of the Boston and Albany and Old Colony Railways.
Its population at that time was about 10,000.
Its graded schools are among the first in the State.
It supports several banks and newspapers and is
engaged in the manufacture of woollens, rubber goods,
boots and shoes, harness and machinery.</p>
<p>The ride from South Framingham to Worcester
was uneventful if I except the pelting rain which
from drizzle to down-pour followed me from start to
finish. Indeed, it really seemed as though the first
days of my journey were to be baptismal days and
I regret exceedingly that these early stages of the trip
were not more propitious; for, had the weather been
less disagreeable, I should have seen Eastern Massachusetts
under much more favorable circumstances.</p>
<p>The city limits of Worcester were reached at four
o'clock in the afternoon and a half hour later I was
registered at the Bay State House. Many relatives
called upon me here, most of whom were residents of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the city and vicinity. Lectured at the Opera House
in the evening, being introduced to my audience by
Colonel Finley of Charlestown, to whom previous
reference has been made, and with whom I had
arranged to accompany me as far as Syracuse, New
York, and further if my advance agents should think
it advisable for him to do so.</p>
<p>The fact that both my father and mother were natives
of Worcester County and that most of our
ancestors for several generations had been residents
of Worcester and vicinity made that city of unusual
interest to me, and I trust the reader will be indulgent
if I allot too much space or seem too
partial in my description of this early landmark in my
journey.</p>
<p>Worcester, nestling among the hills along the
Blackstone River, the second city in Massachusetts,
the heart of the Commonwealth, has a population of
about 85,000.</p>
<p>Shut in by its wall of hills, it seemed, as I first came
into it, something like a little miniature world in itself.
It possesses some share of all the good we know.
Nature, that "comely mother," has laid her caressing
hand upon it. Art has made many a beautiful structure
to adorn its streets. Commerce smiles upon it.
While its wonderful manufactures seem to form
a great living, throbbing heart for the city.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a></span></p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption6">VIEW IN WORCESTER MASSACHUSETTS.</span>
</div>
<p>Sauntering up from the depot, through Front street,
five minutes' walk brought me to the Old Common.
There I found, what one so frequently finds in
Massachusetts towns and cities—namely, a War Monument.
Apparently that mighty five years' struggle,
that brilliant victory, bringing freedom to two million
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>fellow-creatures, bringing power, union, glory to the
nation, has burned itself into the very heart of the
Old Bay State; and lest posterity might forget the
lessons she learned from 1861 to 1865, everywhere
she has planted her war monuments, to remind her
children that</p>
<div class="poem">"Simple duty has no place for fear."</div>
<p>In the shade of Worcester Common is another
object of interest. A little plot of ground, wherein
stands a grand old tomb. It is the resting-place of
Timothy Bigelow, the early patriot of Worcester.
Here in the sunshine and the twilight, in the bloom
of summer, and under the soft falling snows of winter,
he perpetually manifests to the world</p>
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"How sleep the brave, who sink to rest</span><br>
<span class="i0">  By all their country's wishes blest."</span></div>
<p>A sturdy old New Englander was Colonel Bigelow.
"When the news of the destruction of the tea in
Boston Harbor reached him, he was at work in his
blacksmith shop, near the spot now called Lincoln
Square. He immediately laid aside his tools, proceeded
directly to his house, opened the closet, and
took from it a canister of tea, went to the fire-place, and
poured the contents into the flames. As if feeling
that everything which had come in contact with
British legislative tyranny should be purified by fire,
the canister followed the tea; and then he covered
both with coals.</p>
<p>"Before noon on the nineteenth of April, 1775, an
express came to town, shouting, as he passed through
the street at full speed, 'To arms! to arms!—the war's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
begun.' His white horse, bloody with spurring, and
dripping with sweat, fell exhausted by the church.
Another was instantly procured, and the tidings went
on. The bell rang out the alarm, cannon were fired,
and messengers were sent to every part of the town to
collect the soldiery. As the news spread, the implements
of husbandry were thrown by in the field; and
the citizens left their homes, with no longer delay than
to seize their arms. In a short time, the 'minute-men'
were paraded on the green, under Captain Timothy
Bigelow. After fervent prayer by Rev. Mr. Maccarty,
they took up their line of march to the scene of conflict."
Such was Bigelow's zeal and ardor in the
great cause of the times, that he appeared on the following
morning, at the head of his "minute-men," in
the square at Watertown, having marched them there,
a distance of over thirty miles, during that one short
night.</p>
<p>On the nineteenth of April, 1861, the Bigelow Monument
was dedicated. At the very hour of the consecration
exercises, the Massachusetts Sixth Regiment
was engaged in its memorable struggle and triumphant
passage through the blockaded streets of Baltimore at
the beginning of the Civil War.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a></span></p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption7">A NEW ENGLAND PAPER MILL.</span>
</div>
<p>Along the west side of the Old Common runs Main
street, just out of which, in Pearl street, is the Post
Office. I have seen a curious computation with regard
to that Post Office development, which aptly illustrates
the rapid growth of Worcester. The number of
letters sent out in 1809 was about 4,400. The number
of letters taken out fifty years later was 523,808.
Main street reaches Lincoln Square, where stand the
two court houses. The old one has been removed a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
few feet, and refitted. In it the criminal courts are
held; there too are the offices of the court of probate
and insolvency.</p>
<p>The New Court House was built in 1845 of Quincy
granite, at a cost of about one hundred thousand
dollars. In it the civil terms of the courts are held,
with numerous ante-rooms for the jurors and for consultation.
The lower floor is occupied by the office of
the register of deeds, and by the clerk's and treasurer's
offices.</p>
<p>Close neighbor to the court houses is the building
containing the rooms of the American Antiquarian
Society, one of the leading learned bodies of our
country. It was founded in 1812. It possesses a
very valuable library, especially rich on subjects of
local interest to Americans. The newspapers filed here
include over four thousand volumes, beginning with
the Boston <i>News Letter</i> of 1804, and closing with the
great journals of to-day. This same society also
possesses a very interesting collection of pre-historic
American relics.</p>
<p>In Lincoln Square stands the old Salisbury mansion,
an interesting specimen of a colonial house,
which has been standing a century or so, since the
time when those substantial buildings, with their wide
halls, high ceilings, and strong walls, were built on
honor. There it has stood in its dignity, more
flimsy, more showy architecture springing up around
it, until now the <i>fin de siècle</i> eye discovers that
nothing is more to be desired than one of these same
sturdy old colonial houses.</p>
<p>Main street contains many churches. On it is the
large, ugly-looking, but justly celebrated, Clark University,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
which is devoted to scientific research, with its
wonderfully equipped chemical laboratory.</p>
<p>Any one who wants a bird's-eye view of Worcester
and its environments, can easily have it by strolling
out Highland street to Newton Hill. It is only about
a mile from Lincoln Park, but it is six hundred and
seventy feet above the sea level, and from it "the
whole world, and the glory thereof," seems spread out
at one's feet.</p>
<p>On Salisbury street, one mile from the square,
stands the house in which George Bancroft, the historian,
dear to American hearts, was born.</p>
<p>A mile and a half from the square, on Salisbury
Pond, are located the famous Wire Works of Washburn
and Moen.</p>
<p>There are many buildings to interest the visitor in
Worcester. The State Lunatic Asylum, with its one
thousand patients; the free Public Library on Elm
street, containing eighty thousand volumes; the High
School on Walnut street; the Museum of the National
Historical Society, on Foster street; All Saint's
Church; the Polytechnic Institute; the College of
the Holy Cross, six hundred and ninety feet above the
sea, and many another place of interest, calling on the
passers-by to look, and learn of the world's advancement.</p>
<p>Standing on one of the heights overlooking the
little river, the surrounding hills, the busy city, throbbing
with its many manufactories, it seemed to me I
had before my eyes an object lesson of the wonderful
resources, the vim, the power of making "all things
work together for good," which I take to be the vital
characteristic of American manhood.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>I remembered reading that in 1767 a committee
was appointed to decide whether it would be wise to
attempt to locate a village on the present site of
Worcester.</p>
<p>They reported that the place was one day's journey
from Boston, and one day's journey from Springfield,
that the place was well watered by streams and
brooks, and that in eight miles square there was
enough meadow to warrant the settling of sixty
families, adding these words: "We recommend that a
prudent and able committee be appointed to lay it out,
and that due care be taken by said committee that a
good minister of God's Word be placed there, as soon
as may be, that such people as be there planted may
not live like lambs in a large place."</p>
<p>That was only a little more than a century ago.
As I stood overlooking it all, "thickly dotted with
the homes of the husbandmen, and the villages of the
manufacturer, traversed by canal and railway, and
supporting a dense population," proving so strong a
contrast between the past generation's humble anticipations,
and our overflowing prosperity, I asked
myself what those old Puritans would have thought
of our railroads, our electric cars, our modern machines,
our telephones; and I said, with a spirit of
self-gratulation,</p>
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"We are living, we are dwelling,</span><br>
<span class="i0">  In a grand and awful time;</span><br>
<span class="i0">  In an age on ages telling,</span><br>
<span class="i0">  To be living is sublime."</span>
</div>
<p>There is little doubt that future generations will

<h4>Third and Fourth Days.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Bates House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Springfield, Massachusetts</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>May Eleventh</i>.</div>
<p>Lowering clouds and a slight fall of rain again confronted
me as I mounted <i>Paul</i> at seven o'clock on the
morning of the Third Day in front of the Bay State
House, Worcester, and rode out to the Boston and
Albany Turnpike. The prospect of meeting my wife
and daughter, whom I had not seen for several months,
and the lecture appointment for Springfield made this
one of the memorable days of my journey for speed
and endurance. Fifty-four miles were whirled off in
eight hours and the fact established that <i>Paul</i> could
be relied upon to do all that was required of him.</p>
<p>I had hardly dismounted in front of the Bates
House when Mrs. Glazier and Alice came running
from the hotel to greet me. They had been visiting
in Hartford and had come up to Springfield early in
the morning, reaching the city several hours before
my arrival. This visit with my family at Springfield
was one of the pleasant episodes of my journey and
long to be remembered in connection with my ride
across the Bay State.</p>
<p>My lecture was delivered at the Haynes Opera
House, whither I was escorted by comrades of the
G. A. R. The introduction was by Captain Smith,
Commander of the Springfield Post, who spoke
pleasantly of my army and prison experiences and of
the objects of my lecture tour.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a></span></p>

</div>
<p>Hastening back to the Bates House after the lecture,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the remainder of the evening was spent with my wife
and daughter and a few friends who had called for a
social talk and to tell me something of the early
history of Springfield and vicinity.</p>
<p>As the lecture appointment for Pittsfield was set for
the fifteenth I readily discovered by a simple calculation
that I could easily spend another day with Hattie
and Alice and still reach Pittsfield early in the afternoon
of the fifteenth. The leisure thus found was
devoted to strolls in and around Springfield and a
careful study of the city and its environs.</p>
<p>When King Charles the First had dissolved his third
parliament, thus putting his head on the bleeding heart
of puritanism, there lived in Springfield, England, a
warden of the established church. "He was thirty-nine
years of age, of gentle birth, acute, restive, and
singularly self-assertive. He had seen some of the
stoutest men of the realm break into tears when the
King had cut off free speech in the Commons; he had
seen ritualism, like an iron collar, clasped upon the
neck of the church, while a young jewelled courtier,
the Duke of Buckingham, dangled the reputation of
sober England at his waistcoat. A colonial enterprise,
pushed by some Lincolnshire gentlemen, had
been noised abroad, and the warden joined his fortunes
with them, and thus became one of the original
incorporators mentioned in the Royal Charter of the
Massachusetts Bay Company in America. This was
William Pinchon." After reaching this country he
became treasurer of the colony, and a member of the
general court. He formed plans for a coast trade, and
for a trade with the Indians.</p>
<p>Such was the man of mark, who in 1636, with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
colony of friends, made a settlement on the fertile
meadows of the Indian Agawam. The spot was
obtained by a deed signed by thirteen Indians, and
Pinchon, in loving remembrance of his old English
home, christened the new settlement Springfield.
From the little we can glean of them, the ancient
inhabitants of the village must have been a grim old
race.</p>
<p>Hugh Parsons, and Mary, his wife, were tried for
witchcraft.</p>
<p>Goodwife Hunter was gagged and made to stand in
the stocks for "Sundry exhorbitance of ye toung."</p>
<p>Men were fined for not attending town meeting and
voting.</p>
<p>In August, 1734, the Rev. Robert Breck was called
to the church in Springfield.</p>
<p>Shortly before that he had used the following words
in one of his sermons: "What will become of the
heathen who never heard of the gospel, I do not pretend
to say, but I cannot but indulge a hope that God,
in his boundless benevolence, will find out a way
whereby those heathen who act up to the light they
have may be saved."</p>
<p>The news of this alarming hope came to Springfield,
and a few other so-called unorthodox utterances
were attributed to him. "In the minds of the
River Gods heterodoxy was his crime. For this the
Rev. gentleman was not only tried by a council of the
church, but a sheriff and his posse appeared and
arrested Mr. Breck in his Majesty's name, and the
prisoner was taken first to the town-house, and afterward
to New London for trial."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a></span></p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption9">A MASSACHUSETTS MILL STREAM.</span>
</div>
<p>The early Springfield settlers had few of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
articles which we consider the commonest comforts of
life.</p>
<p>Hon. John Worthington, "One of the Gods of the
Connecticut Valley," owned the first umbrella in
Springfield. He never profaned the article by
carrying it in the rain, but used it as a sun-shade
only.</p>
<p>In 1753 there was but one clock in Springfield. It
was considered a great curiosity, and people used to
stop to hear it strike.</p>
<p>As early as about 1774 that wonderful innovation,
a cooking-stove, made its appearance in Springfield.
The stove was made in Philadelphia, and weighed
eight or nine hundred pounds.</p>
<p>It was 1810 when David Ames brought the first
piano into the little settlement.</p>
<p>We are furnished with a description of Springfield
in 1789 by the journal of the Great Washington.
Under the date of October twenty-first he wrote,
"There is a great equality in the people of this
State. Few or no opulent men, and no poor. Great
similitude in their buildings, the general fashion of
which is a chimney—always of brick or stone—and a
door in the middle, with a staircase fronting the
latter, and running up by the side of the former; two
flush stories, with a very good show of sash and glass
windows; the size generally from thirty to fifty feet
in length, and from twenty to thirty in width, exclusive
of a back shed, which seems to be added as the
family increases."</p>
<p>Much later in our national history, Springfield
became one of the most important stations of the
"Underground Railroad."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<p>In a back room on Main street can still be seen a
fire-place, preserved as a memento of stirring days,
when many a negro was pushed up through it, to be
secreted in the great chimney above.</p>
<p>Springfield has had many noted citizens. The historian
Bancroft lived there at one time; so did John
Brown, of Harper's Ferry fame.</p>
<p>George Ashman, a brilliant member of the local
bar, was made chairman of the famous Chicago convention
of 1860 which nominated Abraham Lincoln
for President. Mr. Ashman also had the honor to
convey the formal notice of the nomination to Lincoln
in Springfield, Illinois.</p>
<p>Dr. J. G. Holland lived in Springfield, where all
of his prose works first made their appearance, in the
columns of the <i>Springfield Republican</i>.</p>
<p>No spot in Springfield is more interesting to those
fortunate enough to see it than the United States
Arsenal.</p>
<p>Springfield Armory was established by act of Congress,
April, 1794, its site having been accepted by
Washington in 1789. The plant consists of the
Armory and Arsenal on the hill, and the water shops,
distant about two miles, on Mill River. Main
Arsenal is on a bluff overlooking the city, and is one
hundred and sixty feet above the river. It is a partial
copy of East India House in London. From its tower
there is a wonderful view of the surrounding country,
and one which was greatly admired by Charles Dickens
during his visit to America.</p>
<p>The Main Arsenal is two hundred feet by seventy,
and is three stories high, each floor having storage
capacity for one hundred thousand stand of arms.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a></span></p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption10">THE SPRINGFIELD ARMORY.</span>

<p>Longfellow's lines have made this a classic spot:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This is the Arsenal. From floor to ceiling,</span><br>
<span class="i1">Like a huge organ, rise the burnished arms;</span><br>

<span class="i0">The holy melodies of love arise."</span>
</div></div>
<p>Beside the Main Arsenal, two other buildings are
used for the storage of arms.</p>
<p>In 1795 Uncle Sam made his first musket. That
year forty or fifty men were employed, and 245
muskets were made. Between that and the present
time over 2,000,000 weapons have been turned out.
During that time $32,500,000 have been expended.
When Sumter was fired on about 1,000 weapons per
month were being made. Three months later, 3,000
were made each month. In 1864, 1,000 muskets were
completed each day, and 3,400 men were employed,
with pay roll sometimes amounting to $200,000 per
month. At present only 400 men are employed.</p>
<p>From Springfield stock have come eight college
presidents, namely of Yale, Harvard, Columbia,
Amherst, Princeton, Trinity, Beloit, and Dickinson.</p>
<p>Springfield of to-day is a thriving city of about
50,000, and is the county seat of Hampden County.
Some one, I think, has called it the "city of homes."
Its streets are broad, and well shaded by elms and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
maples; many of its residences are detached, and as
a whole it bears the stamp of taste and refinement.</p>
<p>Springfield is within easy reach of many points of
interest. It is ninety-eight miles from Boston, one
hundred and twenty miles from New York, and
twenty-six miles from Hartford.</p>
<p>The growth of the Springfield Street Railroad
Company has been phenomenal. In 1869 this company
started out with only $50,000 capital stock. Its
length was only about two miles. It had only four
cars and twenty-five horses. Three years ago horses
were displaced by electricity. Now, in the busy season,
the daily mileage of transit on the thirty-five miles of
track is equal to the distance from Springfield to San
Francisco and half-way back. During the fiscal year
closing October first, 1892, 7,500,000 fares were taken.</p>
<p>The stores of Springfield are remarkably large and
tasteful. Haynes &amp; Company have the largest clothing
house in Massachusetts, out of Boston.</p>
<p>In 1875 Meakins &amp; Packard started in business
with only one boy to help them. Now their building
is one hundred feet square, and seven stories high,
while they now have over one hundred employees.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a></span></p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption11">A MILL IN THE BERKSHIRE HILLS.</span>
</div>
<p>Springfield has three great manufactories, Smith
&amp; Wesson Pistol Works; R. F. Hawkins Iron
Works; and the Wesson Car Manufactory. Smith &amp;
Wesson employ about 500 men, with an annual output
of 80,000 weapons. They ship goods to Russia and
other countries. The Wesson Car Company in 1860
sent $300,000 worth of goods to the Egyptian government.
They have also done considerable work for
South America. They have done $150,000 worth for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>the New Jersey Central Railroad, and $1,700,000
worth for the Central Pacific Railroad.</p>
<p>The City Library was built at a cost of $100,000,
and contains 80,000 books. Adjoining the library is
the beautiful new art building, containing a rare and
costly collection of curiosities.</p>
<p>The City Hall is a building in the Romanesque style.
It contains a public hall with a seating capacity of
2,700.</p>
<p>The Court House is an imposing structure, is built
of granite, and cost $200,000.</p>
<p>The city has many a lovely spot in which to
recreate. Imagine four hundred acres, woodland alternating
with highly cultivated lawns, and stretches
of blooming plants. Imagine in the midst of this a
deep ravine, with a brawling little brook through it.
Imagine five lakelets covered by Egyptian lotus, and
the different varieties of water-lilies. Through all
this loveliness, think of seven miles of charming
drives, winding in and out like a ribbon, and you
have in your mind a picture of Springfield's enchanting
Forest Park.</p>
<h4>Fifth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Russell House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Russell, Massachusetts</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>May Thirteenth</i>.</div>
<p>My wife and daughter were not easily reconciled
to my leavetaking of Springfield, but yielding to the
inevitable, adieus were quickly said, <i>Paul</i> was mounted
and I rode slowly away from the Bates House, turning
occasionally in the saddle until entirely out of
sight of my loved ones, then putting spurs to my horse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
galloped out to the turnpike and headed for Russell,
the evening objective.</p>
<p>Considerable rain fell during the day and the roads
at this time through Western Massachusetts were in
a wretched condition. With clothing thoroughly
soaked and mud anywhere from ankle to knee deep,
the trip from Springfield to Russell was anything but
what I had pictured when planning my overland tour
in the saddle. Some consolation was found, however,
in recalling similar experiences in the army and I
resolved to allow nothing to depress or turn me from
my original purpose. A halt was made for dinner
during this day's ride, at a country inn or tavern ten
miles west of Springfield.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that I did not leave
Springfield until nearly ten o'clock in the morning,
and that I was out of the saddle over an hour on
account of dinner, and compelled to face a pelting
storm throughout the day, I did well to advance
eighteen miles by four o'clock, the time of dismounting
at the Russell House.</p>
<p>Russell is one of the most beautiful of the numerous
villages of Hampden County, and is picturesquely
situated among the Berkshire Hills in the western
part of the State. It stands on the banks of the
Westfield River, upon which it relies for water-power
in the manufacture of paper, its only industry. It
has direct communication with Eastern and Western
Massachusetts through the Boston and Albany Railway,
and while it is not likely that it will ever come to
anything pretentious, it will always be, in appearance
at least, a rugged and romantic-looking little village.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a></span></p>

<h4>Sixth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Becket House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Becket, Massachusetts</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>May Fourteenth</i>.</div>
<p>Mounted <i>Paul</i> in front of the hotel at Russell at
nine o'clock in the morning to ride towards Chester,
along the bank of the Westfield River. This swift
branch of the Connecticut runs along between its
green banks fertilizing the meadows and turning the
factory wheels that here and there dip down into its
busy current. The Indian name "Agawam," by which
it is known nearer its mouth, seems more appropriate
for the wild little stream, and often, while I was following
its course, I thought of the banished Red Men
who had given it this musical name and who had once
built their wigwams along its shores.</p>
<p>On this morning the air was fresh and the view
pleasing under the magical influence of spring, and
both were none the less enjoyed by the assurance
that dinner could be had at our next stopping-place.
Upon dismounting, I found that the ride could not
have been as agreeable to <i>Paul</i> as to his master, for
his back was in a very sore condition. Everything
was done for his comfort; cold water and castile soap
being applied to relieve the injured parts, and the
cumbersome saddle-cloth which had been doing duty
since we left Boston was discarded for a simple blanket
such as I had used while in the cavalry service. This
was a change for the better and was made at the right
time, for, as I afterwards had some difficulty in keeping
the direct road, the equipment of my horse relieved
what might have proved a fatiguing day's ride.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
As it was, the novelty of being lost, which was my experience
on this occasion, had its advantages, for a
wanderer in the Berkshire Hills finds much to suit the
fancy and to please the eye. At six o'clock, notwithstanding
the delay, we came into Becket, where Edwin
Lee, the proprietor of the hotel of the place, told me I
was the only guest.</p>
<p>Becket is an enterprising little village, thirty-seven
miles northwest of Springfield, having a graded
school and several manufactories. The scenery throughout
the region is rugged and attractive, a charming
characteristic of the Bay State.</p>
<h4>Seventh Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Berkshire House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Pittsfield, Massachusetts</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>May Fifteenth</i>.</div>
<p>Rode away from Becket at eight o'clock in the
morning, and on the way found it necessary to favor
<i>Paul</i> in this day's ride; so I dismounted and walked
several miles. This was not a disagreeable task, for
my journey lay over the picturesque Hoosac Mountains
whose wooded sides and fertile valleys were almost a
fairyland of loveliness at this season. Owing to this
delay, Pittsfield was not reached until one o'clock.
Here I delivered my fourth lecture at the Academy
of Music, Captain Brewster, commander of the Pittsfield
Post, G. A. R., introducing me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a></span></p>

<h4>Eighth Day</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Berkshire House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Pittsfield, Massachusetts</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>May Sixteenth</i>.</div>
<p>Spent the morning at the "Berkshire," posting my
journal and attending to private and business correspondence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
The afternoon was passed in a stroll
through the town, where I saw much that was of interest
and gathered some information concerning its early
history, progress and present condition.</p>
<p>Of the fourteen counties of Massachusetts, the most
strongly marked and highly favored is Berkshire, with
its four cardinal boundaries, formed by four different
states. To one who sees, for the first time, the luxuriance
of its vegetation, the beauty of its forest-covered
hills, the broad shady avenues of its villages,
with their palatial homes, it seems as if Nature and
wealth had combined to make this spot a veritable
"Garden of the Gods."</p>
<p>In the exact centre of all this loveliness, more than
1,000 feet above the level of the sea, lies the little
city of Pittsfield, containing about 16,000 inhabitants.
Its principal streets form a cross, North, South, East,
and West streets meeting at an elliptical grove of
stately elms forming a small park. Here in old days
stood one central tree, its height one hundred and
twenty-eight feet, its bare shaft ninety feet, with many
a memory of the French and Indian wars attached to
it. In 1841, it was struck by lightning. In 1861
it was cut down, even stern men weeping at its fall.
It was replaced by a fountain, whose stream may be
raised to the height of the old tree. This park also
holds a huge shaft of granite, upon which stands the
bronze figure of a soldier, flag in hand. On the
granite are cut the words, "For the dead a tribute, for
the living a memory, for posterity an emblem of devotion
to their country's flag." To the west of the park
is Pittsfield's large brownstone Post Office, it being
the first building on North street, a small business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
thoroughfare, whose stores, with their dainty wares and
tasteful fabrics, would do credit to many a large city.</p>
<p>On the south of the park stands the Athenæum, a
building of rough stone, erected at the cost of $100,000
as a "tribute to art, science, and literature," and presented
to his fellow-townspeople by Thomas Allen.
It contains a large free library, an art gallery, and a
very entertaining museum of curiosities. Next door to
the Athenæum is the large white Court House, said to
have cost $400,000. Across from the Court House, in
a little corner of the park, is a tiny music house, gay
with colored electric lights, where open air evening
concerts are given all through the summer.</p>
<p>On the north of the park stand two of the handsomest
of Pittsfield's eleven churches.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption14">

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption14">A SCENE IN THE BERKSHIRE HILLS.</span>
</div>
<p>The city's manufactories are large and thrifty, but
they, and the operatives who manipulate them, are
tucked away in a corner, so to speak, where they may
not offend the eyes of the opulent inhabitants. Only
in the riotous jostle of Saturday night in the store is
one brought face to face with the fact that beauty,
leisure and wealth do not hold a monopoly of the
sweet Berkshire air. For everything appears so
lovely. The streets are very wide, great stately
avenues, where beautiful strips of the finest lawn border
each edge of the sidewalk. Society is the choicest,
for the summer residences of New York's four hundred
intermingle with the magnificent old mansions
owned by the staunchest of Massachusetts' old blue-blooded
sons and daughters. Cropping out through
the elegance of this little city are some queer old
Yankee traits. Lawlessness there is none. No policemen
guard the park, with its ideal lawns, but a polite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
notice informs passers-by that this being no thoroughfare,
trespassing will not be tolerated, and there is
none. When the concerts are in full blast, people
gather in the walks and drives only. Whole rows of
little street Arabs may be seen on these occasions,
drawn up with their little bare toes touching the very
edge of the precious grass. The open music house is
always left full of chairs, which no one steals, nay,
which no one uses. The entrance to the Court House is
filled with blooming plants. No child, no dog even,
is ill-bred enough to break one.</p>
<p>But the peculiarities of the people, the beauty of
the dwellings, the magnificence of the equipages, the
tide of fashionable life which pours in, summer and
fall, <i>all</i>, <span class="smcap">ALL</span> is forgotten as, from some point of vantage,
the spectator takes in the beauty surrounding
him. "On the west sweep the Taconics, in that
majestic curve, whose grace travelers, familiar with the
mountain scenery of both hemispheres, pronounce unequaled.
On the east the Hoosacs stretch their unbroken
battlements, with white villages at their feet,
and, if the sunlight favors, paths of mingled lawn and
wood, enticing to their summits; while from the
south, 'Greylock, cloud-girdled on his purple throne'
looks grandly across the valley to the giant heights,
keeping watch and ward over the pass where the
mountains throw wide their everlasting gates, to let
the winding Housatonic flow peacefully toward the
sea."</p>
<p>Thus, in taking leave of Massachusetts, I looked
back to the starting-point, and thought with pleasure
of the many beautiful links in the chain connecting
Boston with Pittsfield, none more beautiful than the
last.</p>

<p>Ordered my horse at ten in the morning, and before
riding on stopped at the office of the <i>Berkshire
Eagle</i> to talk a few minutes with the editor. The
route from Pittsfield lay over the Boston and Albany
Turnpike, one of the villages on the way being West
Lebanon. Here we had dinner. While quietly pursuing
my journey afterwards, in crossing the Pittsfield
Mountain, I overtook Egbert Jolls, a farmer, with
whom I had a long and interesting conversation. He
amused me with stories of the Lebanon Shakers, among
whom he had lived many years, and whose peculiar
belief and customs have always set them widely apart
from other sects. Perhaps the most singular point in
their doctrine is that God is dual, combining in the One
Person the eternal Father and Mother of all generated
nature. They believe that the revelation of God is
progressive, and in its last aspect the manifestation was
God revealed in the character of Mother, as an evidence
of Divine affection. Ann Lee, the daughter of a Manchester
blacksmith, is the founder of the sect, and
considered from her holy life to be the human representation
of this Divine duality. This is a strange
belief, and one that is not generally known, but its
adherents have among other good traits one which
commends them to the respect of those who know anything
of them, and that is their sober and industrious
habits.</p>
<p>Soon after crossing the State line between Massachusetts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and New York, we passed the home of Governor
Samuel J. Tilden. Two years before, this popular
Democrat was elected governor, by a plurality of 50,000
votes above his fellow-candidate, John A. Dix. He
won popular attention by his strong opposition to
certain political abuses; notably the Tweed Charter
of 1870; and by incessant activity he was, in 1876,
beginning to reap the laurels of a career which began
while he was a student at Yale.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>FOUR DAYS AT ALBANY.</h3>
<p>Started from Nassau at eleven o'clock,
still following the Boston and Albany
Turnpike, and soon reached the Old
Barringer Homestead. It was with
this family that I spent my first night
in Rensselaer County sixteen years before,
when a lad of seventeen, I was
looking for a school commissioner and
a school to teach. Brockway's was
another well-known landmark which I could not
pass without stopping, for it was here that I boarded
the first week after opening my school at Schodack
Centre in the autumn of 1859. At the school, too,
I dismounted, and found that the teacher was one of
my old scholars. The Lewis family, at the hotel just
beyond, were waiting my approach with wide-open
door; for Oscar Lewis had gone to Albany and had
said before he left: "Keep a sharp lookout for Captain
Glazier, as he will surely pass this way." It was very
pleasant to be met so cordially, although the sight of
well-known faces and landmarks brought back the past
and made me feel like another Rip Van Winkle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a></span></p>

</div>
<p>In crossing the river between Greenbush and Albany,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<i>Paul</i> seemed disinclined to stay on board, so the bars
had to be put up and every precaution taken. It may
have been that the shades of the ferrymen who had
run the little craft for the last two hundred years came
back to vex us. Perhaps the particular ghost of Hendrick
Albertsen, who, two hundred and eight years
ago bargained with Killian Van Rensselaer for the
privilege of running his boat; but whatever the cause
of the disturbance we reached <i>terra firma</i> without accident,
and were soon in the familiar streets of the old
Dutch town; the day's journey agreeably ended with
our trip across the Hudson by the oldest ferry in the
United States.</p>
<p>From the river the view of Albany is picturesque
in the extreme, where the eye catches the first glimpse
of the city, rising from the water's edge, and surmounted
then by its brown-domed Capitol. It was a sight that
had always had a singular charm for me, for many of
the pleasantest hours of my early life were spent here,
where my sisters and I were educated. Here I left
school to enlist at the opening of the Civil War, and
here I published my first book, "Capture, Prison-Pen
and Escape." But even if the city had no claim other
than its own peculiar attractiveness it would hold an
enviable place among its sister cities. The irregularity
of its older streets, the tone of its architecture, the lack
of the usual push and bustle of an American town,
give it an old-world air that makes it interesting.
There is a Common in the centre of the city, shaded
by old elms, and around this stand the public buildings—the
State Hall for state offices and the City Hall for
city offices—both of marble and fronting on the
Common. The Albany Academy, where Joseph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Henry, one of its professors from 1826 to 1832, first
demonstrated his theory of the magnetic telegraph.
A few squares west of the Common was the stretch of
green that has since been set apart for a public park,
where the good people of Albany may find an agreeable
change of scene and an hour's pleasant recreation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 279px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption16">

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption16">STATE STREET AND CAPITOL, ALBANY, NEW YORK.</span>
</div>
<p>The New Capitol, on the site of the Old Capitol, is
a magnificent edifice in the renaissance style, built of
New England granite, at a cost to the State of many
millions. On passing quaint bits of architecture or the
suggestive aspect of some out-of-the way corner, one
turns naturally to the days of wigs and kneebreeches,
before the capital of the Empire State was thought of,
and when the forests of fair Columbia were overrun by
the bronzed warriors who still held undisputed sway.
It was back in these days that Henry Hudson, sent from
Holland by the Dutch East India Company, in sailing
up the "Grande" River in search of a passage to India
and China, found that he could not send his ship
beyond the point where the city of Hudson now stands.
This was discouraging, but sure that the desired passage
was found, he and a few of his men pushed farther on
in a small craft, landing, it is believed, on the present
site of Albany. Later, Hudson and his men returned,
assured that the noble river could not take them where
they had hoped it might. After them came Dutch
traders, led by an enterprising Hollander who had been
with Hudson on his first voyage, and who saw a promising
field in the red man's country. They established
a trading-post where the "Half Moon" had been
moored before, and from here carried on their barter
with the Indians, exchanging attractive trifles for furs.
Other traders followed these, and then came the colonists;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
a brave little band full of hope and eager to try
their fortune in the New World. Their leader was none
other than Killian Van Rensselaer, the wealthy pearl
merchant of Amsterdam, and one of the directors of
the West India Company, who had received a grant
from the Prince of Orange for a large tract of land
about the Upper Hudson, including the present site of
Albany. Here he established his "patroonship," guarding
the affairs of the colony, and providing his tenants
with comfortable houses and ample barns. And more
than this, their spiritual welfare was promoted through
the services of the Reverend Doctor Joanes Megapolensis.
From his personal accounts we read that the
good Dominie found his life among the 'wilden' as full
of peril and unceasing labor as that of his flock; for he
undertook not only the guidance of his own people, but
the enlightenment and conversion of the Indians. To
this end he threw himself into the task of mastering
their language with true missionary zeal; a task which
in those days meant not only difficulty but danger.</p>
<p>Under the shelter of the handsome churches that
grace the streets of the Albany of to-day, we see a
striking contrast in the primitive house where this
pioneer clergyman preached; and from the security
of long-established peace, we look back upon those
sturdy people of Rensselaerwyck who sowed and reaped
and went to church under the protection of the Patroon's
guns.</p>
<p>But there came a day when English ships sailed up
to the harbor at Manhatoes, and demanded the surrender
of the Dutch colonies in the name of the
Duke of York and Albany. The terrified people at
sight of the guns refused to withstand an attack, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the English quietly came into possession. Van Rensselaer
sent down his papers, and Fort Orange surrendered
on the twenty-fourth of September, 1664, soon
after receiving its new name in honor of the Duke's
second title. Twenty-two years later, Albany had the
satisfaction of sending two of her representatives,
Peter Schuyler and Robert Livingston, to New York
to claim her charter as a city; which, upon their return,
was received, according to the old chronicler, "with all
ye joy and acclamation imaginable."</p>
<p>Through the strength of their new dignity and influence
we can trace the spirit of independence which
was beginning to rise in opposition to the unjust English
rule; and it was here in 1754 that the first General
Congress was held to discuss arrangements for the
national defence, when Franklin and his compatriots
"signed the first plan for American Union and proclaimed
to the colonies that they were one people, fit to
govern and able to protect themselves." Later, when
the storm of the Revolution broke, this place, where
the first threatenings were heard, was the most impoverished
by the contest and the most persevering in the
fight; but she came out triumphant, with a record well
meriting the honors received in 1797, when she was
made the capital of the Empire State. After peace
was again established and the routine of business taken
up, Albany became the centre of the entire trade of
Western New York.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a></span></p>

</div>
<p>Fulton's steamboats began to run between Albany
and New York as early as 1809, and this commercial
activity and contact with the world gave an impulse
to the city which has made itself felt all along the
Hudson. Since then it has grown rapidly, and has in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
its steady advancement an influential future to which
its citizens may look forward with pardonable pride.</p>
<p>My arrival in Albany and lecture at Tweddle Hall
on the evening of the eighteenth were to me among
the notable events of my journey. Colonel J. M. Finley,
who accompanied me from Boston, a veteran of the
late war and manager of my lecture course from Boston
to Buffalo, introduced me.</p>
<p>Called at the Capitol on the nineteenth to see
the adjutant-general in relation to my lecturing in the
interest of the fund for the erection of a Soldiers'
Home which at that time interested persons had proposed
to build at Bath, New York. I was presented
to General Townsend by Colonel Taylor, assistant adjutant-general,
whom I had known for several years.
Found that General Townsend was not, as I had been
informed, the treasurer of the fund. Colonel Taylor
then went with me up Washington avenue in search
of Captain John Palmer, Past Department Commander,
G. A. R., whom I was advised to consult on the subject.</p>
<p>These matters attended to, I went in pursuit of
Captain William Blasie and Lieutenant Arthur
Richardson—acquaintances of many years and both
of whom had been the companions of my captivity
in Southern prisons during the War of the Rebellion.</p>
<p>My stay in Albany was prolonged by preparation for
lectures at Troy and Schenectady, and by needed information
concerning the early history and development
of the former city. The second Sunday of my journey
found me here and I went in the morning to the
Presbyterian Church at the corner of Hudson and
Philip streets.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a></span></p>

<h3>ALBANY TO SYRACUSE.</h3>
<h4>Fourteenth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Given's Hotel</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Schenectady, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>May 22, 1876</i>.</div>
<p>Left Albany at eleven o'clock. My
journey to this city led me over the
Schenectady Turnpike. Was compelled
to ride between showers all day as a
rainstorm had set in just as I was
leaving Albany. Stopped for dinner
at Peter Lansing's, whose farm is about
midway between the two cities. This
genial gentleman of old Knickerbocker
stock greatly amused me with his blunt manner and
dry jokes. I was sorry to leave the shelter of his
hospitable roof, especially as the weather was exceedingly
disagreeable, but my engagement to lecture in
Schenectady obliged me to go on. I found it necessary
to ride the last three miles at a gallop in order to avoid
an approaching shower. Reached my hotel at four
o'clock in the afternoon, and lectured in the evening
at Union Hall under the auspices of Post 14, G. A. R.
Several representatives of the city press were with me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
on the platform, and among them was Colonel S. G.
Hamlin, a fellow-prisoner in "Libby" during the war,
and now editor of the <i>Union</i>. In the morning Colonel
Finley went over to Troy to assist Mr. Farrington,
my advance agent, in arranging for my lecture in that
city.</p>
<h4>Fifteenth and Sixteenth Days.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>91 Centre Street</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Schenectady, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>May Twenty-third—Twenty-fourth</i>.</div>
<p>Accepting an invitation to spend a day or two with
friends, I went to 91 Centre street after my lecture.
While here I was occupied chiefly in posting my journal
and in attending to business and private correspondence.
A telegram from Colonel Finley told me that
he had fixed upon the next evening for my lecture at
Harmony Hall, Troy. Acting upon this plan I went
over to Troy the following afternoon by way of
Albany. Called on Captain Palmer in the latter city,
and handed him the proceeds of my lecture at
Schenectady, which he at once transmitted to the fund
in aid of the Soldiers' Home. While in Troy I met
R. H. Ferguson, Hon. Martin I. Townsend, the McCoys
and many other friends and acquaintances of
Auld Lang Syne. I may add that this was the only
instance in my journey thus far in which I had deviated
from a direct line of march.</p>
<h4>Seventeenth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>91 Centre Street</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Schenectady, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>May Twenty-fifth</i>.</div>
<p>Returned to Schenectady by way of Albany after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
my lecture at Troy. Was very busy at this time in
organizing for my lecture campaign between Schenectady
and Buffalo. There was rather a surprising announcement
in the afternoon's <i>Union</i> to the effect that
I had left for Little Falls. I did not learn from what
source Comrade Hamlin of that paper received his information.
Colonel Finley went on to Utica, where
he was joined by Mr. Farrington.</p>
<p>During my stay here I became interested in the place
and found that Schenectady was as rich in legends and
story as her neighbors. She counts her birthday among
the historic dates of America, having begun her career in
1620, when the Mohawks were still holding their councils
of war and spreading the terror of their name. Here
in their very haunts a band of courageous Dutchmen established
a trading-post and began the work of civilization.
This brave colony did not find life as peaceful as
the innocent aspect of Nature would suggest, however,
for in the winter of 1690 the French and Indians began
their terrible work, burning the houses and massacreing
the inhabitants. It was only through a baptism
of blood that the small trading-post developed into a
city. Now it was one of the most flourishing and important
towns in the valley; and the transformation was
so complete that it is almost impossible to realize that
this was the scene of so many struggles. The Schenectady
of to-day is a busy manufacturing town, with a
prosperous farming district about it, whose cornfields
and orchards attest the richness of the soil. It is the
seat of Union College, a well-known institution of
rich endowments and possessing a handsome library
of 15,000 volumes. The college was founded in 1795
by a union of several religious sects. Its buildings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
are plain and substantial, their stuccoed walls suggestive
of the good solid work that is accomplished within
them from year to year.</p>
<h4>Eighteenth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Union Hotel,     </i></div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Fonda, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>May Twenty-sixth</i>.</div>
<p>Moved from Schenectady at eight o'clock in the
morning. Found the weather delightful and the scenery
charming. On either side were the meadows dotted
with spring flowers and fertilized by the river, whose
shore line of willows and elms was bright with new
green. If I were to except the Berkshire Hills, I saw
nothing in Massachusetts to surpass, or even equal, the
Valley of the Mohawk. It surprised me that poet and
novelist had apparently found so little here for legendary
romance.</p>
<p>Had dinner at Amsterdam, sixteen miles from
Schenectady, and while halted here had <i>Paul</i> shod
for the first time since leaving Boston. Resumed my
journey at four o'clock and reached Fonda two hours
later. Made twenty-six miles during the day and was
now 243 miles from the "Hub." Through the courtesy
of Mr. Fisher, my landlord at this place, I was
given a verbal sketch of Fonda which made a pleasant
addition to my own small store of information.
There were no striking characteristics here to attract
the traveller's eye and history had not chronicled its
modest advancement, but for those who enjoy the sight
of peace and prosperity, Fonda has a charm of its own.
Around it on all sides the grain fields were under excellent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
cultivation, with here and there a well-stocked
farm, suggesting an agricultural and dairying centre.
I found a good night's rest here, envied the people
their peaceful existence, and rode away with a sense
of complete refreshment.</p>
<h4>Nineteenth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Briggs House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Saint Johnsville, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>May Twenty-seventh</i>.</div>
<p>Called for <i>Paul</i> at eight o'clock, and after halting a
moment at the office of the <i>Mohawk Valley Democrat</i>,
crossed the river to Fultonville, which is connected
with Fonda by a substantial iron bridge. Passing
through this town, an enterprising one for its size, I
continued my journey along the south bank of the
Mohawk until I reached Canajoharie, where I stopped
at the Eldridge House for dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a></span></p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption19">A MILL STREAM IN THE MOHAWK VALLEY.</span>
</div>
<p>Here I met another Socrates who had a "favorite
prescription" for healing the sore on <i>Paul's</i> back.
Spent an hour very pleasantly in the office of the
<i>Mohawk Valley Register</i> at Fort Plain, where I learned
that Charles W. Elliott of this paper is a son of
George W. Elliott, author of "Bonnie Eloise." For
many years this song was a great favorite, not only
along the Mohawk, but all over the country, and is
certainly one of the sweetest ballads of America.
There is a swing to the rhythm and charm in the lines
which keeps it in memory, and in riding along
through the scenes it describes, my thoughts go back
to the old days in Rensselaer County, where as a boy
I first heard the words.</p>

</div>
<p>Reached this place at seven o'clock in the evening
and will go on to Little Falls after dinner to-morrow.
In the morning I had an opportunity to look about me
and admire the unusually fine scenery whose romantic
aspect was heightened by a rugged tip of the Adirondacks
which runs down into the valley at that point.
At the foot of the mountain lies the brisk little town
of Saint Johnsville, whose manufacturing interests
have given it a reputation for miles around.</p>
<h4>Twentieth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Girvan House,</i></div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Little Falls, New York,</span></div>
<div class="signature"><i>May Twenty-eighth.      </i></div>
<p>Rode to this place from Saint Johnsville after five
o'clock in the afternoon, taking the north bank of the
river. The effect of the scene in front of me as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
traced my way along the valley was most striking.
Nearer the town my eye caught the picturesque masses
of rock lifting their rugged sides to a height of five
hundred feet, the swift waters of the Mohawk rushing
along between them. The homes perched all along on
the steep hills suggested Swiss scenes and Alpine
journeys, but the busy hum and characteristic American
push soon dissipated these fancies. The rapid fall
of the river here is of great benefit to the manufacturers
who are making good use of their excellent water-power
in the paper and woollen mills.</p>
<p>Soon after my arrival, several citizens came into the
hotel to learn the particulars of my journey, but before
I had time to register, Postmaster Stafford made himself
known and introduced me to several of his friends
and acquaintances, among them General Curtis and
Major Lintner. A laughable story was related which
afforded considerable amusement soon after I rode
into town. It seems that a credulous old lady
from the country had been led to believe that a
cavalryman would ride through the place that night
on the horse which General Washington rode during
the Revolution. A story suggested, no doubt, by the
subject of my lecture. She had come in to sell her
firkin of butter and had waited until long after dark
for the rider and his ancient steed, while the objects
of her misguided interest were resting in Saint Johnsville
unconscious of the disappointment they were
causing.</p>
<p>Let us hope that she never discovered her mistake,
for the old are often sensitive on such points. It is
better at times to suffer keen disappointment than to
find we have been too credulous.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a></span></p>

<h4>Twenty-first Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>12 Cornelia Street</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Utica, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>May Twenty-ninth</i>.</div>
<p>After considerable trouble in finding a saddle blanket
for <i>Paul</i>, to take the place of the saddle cloth used
until we reached Little Falls, I started from that
romantic town at nine o'clock, halting at Ilion for
dinner. This village, well known through the firm of
the Remingtons, is on the south bank of the Mohawk,
twelve miles from Utica. From here the famous
Remington machines and rifles are sent all over the
world.</p>
<p>Farrington met me two miles east of Utica and
escorted me back to the city, conducting Colonel Finley
and myself to rooms which had been engaged for us
through the hospitality of J. C. Bates.</p>
<p>Left my pleasant quarters here to make a few observations
about town, and found much to arrest my
attention. A century ago Utica was known as "Old
Fort Schuyler" from a small stockade of that name,
built on the site in 1750. As the country grew more
peaceful, and the life of the future city began, the
name was changed. A gradual slope of the land from
the river gave from the more elevated parts some very
fine views; and the public parks with their shade
trees and gay flowers made a rich adornment to a naturally
attractive city. The great Erie Canal passes
through the centre of the city and is joined by the
Chenango Canal at this point. Among the landmarks
are the homes of Roscoe Conkling and Horatio Seymour.</p>

<div class="signature"><i>May Thirtieth</i>.</div>
<p>Was compelled to remain in Utica until four o'clock
in the afternoon in order to have my saddle padded.
This brief delay, while favoring my equine friend, was
in some particulars also favorable to his rider, as it afforded
me an excellent opportunity to gather information
I desired concerning the growth of this enterprising
town.</p>
<p>Rode up to Rome on the south bank of the
Mohawk. Soon after my arrival at the Stanwix I
met a large number of Grand Army comrades. Room
"14" had been engaged and made a rendezvous, and
here until a late hour the experiences of the late war
were told over again and our battles re-fought. This
gathering of comrades to celebrate Memorial Day was
marked by deep and enthusiastic feeling; and, although
my day's journey had somewhat fatigued me, I felt
this was no time to show a lack of spirit; so I cheerfully
yielded to the old maxim, "When in Rome do as
the Romans do." Through the courtesy of Captain
Joseph Porter, then Commander of Skillen Post 47, I
was introduced to Hon. H. J. Coggeshall, of Waterville,
Colonel G. A. Cantine, Hon. W. F. Bliss, Mr.
Taylor, editor of the <i>Sentinel</i>, and many others.</p>
<p>Rome lies on a level stretch of land at the head of
the valley, whence I could see its spires as I
approached. On its site once stood old Fort Stanwix,
of Revolutionary fame, which cost the British £660,000
sterling. It was built as a defence against the French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
in Canada, and was the first settlement before the
French War. From that time until the close of the
Revolution it was an important frontier post. Rome
is the centre of a large dairying interest, the cheese
factory system having originated here.</p>

<p>Had a late breakfast at the Stanwix and, after a
stroll through the streets of Rome, called for my horse
at ten o'clock, and bidding adieu to Grand Army comrades
who had assembled to see me start from their
city, mounted and rode out of town. The journey,
as usual, since leaving Albany, lay along the New
York Central. The roads were dry and favorable,
the weather settled, and the scenery through this section
of the Empire State such as to make my journey
most enjoyable. Chittenango was not reached until
ten o'clock, as the distance from Rome made this one
of the longest rides noted in a single day. The twinkling
lights of the village looked very pleasant as I
neared my destination, marking here and there the
homes of its hundreds of inhabitants. I found upon
inquiry at the Chittenango House that I was the only
guest, which augured well for a good night's sleep.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>TWO DAYS AT SYRACUSE.</h3>
<p>Had an early breakfast at Chittenango and
calling for <i>Paul</i> at eight o'clock mounted
and rode forward, with the city of Syracuse
as my evening destination. Nothing
of especial interest occurred to vary the
day's journey. Syracuse was reached at
four o'clock in the afternoon, and the
remainder of the day was spent in walks
and drives through the city which I had
visited several times in former years, and of whose history
I had a fair knowledge. Long before the white man
came, a band of Iroquois had built their wigwams in the
low basin, almost entirely surrounded by hills, that lies to
the south of Lake Onondaga, and from here followed
the pursuits of war and peace. We first hear of this
Indian village in 1653 through the Jesuit missionary,
Father Le Moyne, who had come to establish good
feeling between the Iroquois and other Indian tribes;
and we see strange evidences of a counteracting influence
made probably by his own countrymen in
the discovery of European weapons and ammunition,
that were distributed among the red men about the
same time. For more than a hundred years after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
this, the present site of Syracuse, then an unpromising
stretch of swamps, was the home of the
wolf and bear. Over its dreary waste the cry of
the wild cat, the warning of the rattlesnake and the
hooting of the owl lent their sounds to the weird chorus
of Nature, and it was here that the wily Indian came to
seek his game. It was through Father Le Moyne,
too, that we hear of the great Salt Springs, which he
visited at the southern end of the lake in company
with some Huron and Onondaga chiefs. The Indians,
unable to comprehend the strange effect of salt and
clear water bubbling from the same fountain, had a
superstition that the springs were possessed by an evil
spirit and were afraid to drink from them; but when
the white man began to share their old haunts, we hear
of the bewitched water being fearlessly used, and the
evil spirit converted into a propitious one. It was
Major Asa Danforth and his companion, Colonel Comfort
Tyler, who began early in the present century the
enterprise which has since proved such a splendid success.
These two pioneers started out afoot for the
springs with no other implements than an axe, chain
and kettle, which seem primitive enough to us who
know of the means that are now employed in the making
of this great staple. Arrived at the springs, two
young trees were cut, a stout branch placed in their
crochets and on this the kettle was hung. When the
work was finished, the men hid their implements in the
bushes for safety, shouldered their rich possession and
started home over the ground that in a few years was
to be the scene of such striking and sudden changes.</p>
<p>Joshua Forman was the first man who saw a promising
field in the unhealthy land south of Lake Onondaga,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and it was he who first thought of a plan for its
improvement.</p>
<p>With characteristic persistency he carried out his
ideas, and with the co-operation of James Geddes, a
surveyor and fellow-townsman, did more to convince
men of the practicability of laying a canal route
through central New York than any other man. At
that time the advocate of such an undertaking was considered
mad. Even the President shared the public
view of the matter, and when the zealous member from
Onondaga laid the plans before this incredulous gentleman,
Jefferson remarked: "It is a splendid project,
and may be executed a century hence." It must have
been a satisfaction to Judge Forman to see this inland
water-course completed a few years later, and to realize
the success of the great enterprise.</p>
<p>When the breaking up of the unhealthy soil caused
so much sickness and so many deaths during the building
of the canal at Syracuse—then "Corinth"—this
thoughtful benefactor began to devise a way for improving
the ground, which resulted in the passage of
a bill, a year later, for lowering the lake by means of
drains. This stopped the injurious overflow that occurred
during the spring months and eventually put
an end to the "Corduroy" and "gridiron" roads by
which the "dreary waste of swamp" had been hitherto
approached.</p>
<p>It seems strange enough now, to one riding through
the beautiful and regular streets of the present city, to
realize that only a few years ago its pioneers either
followed these rough routes, or went around by the
hills to avoid them.</p>
<p>In April, 1820, Syracuse had grown sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to merit the distinction of a Post Office, and with
this new acquisition a discussion arose about its
name. It had been called successively "Webster's
Landing," "South Salina," "Bogardus Corners,"
"Cossit's Corners" and "Milan;" but, as there was
another "Milan" in the State, its last title had to be
abandoned. For awhile it was known as "Corinth,"
but finally by an odd coincidence it was named by its
first Postmaster, John Wilkinson, after the old Sicilian
capital, to which it was supposed to bear a slight
resemblance. Mr. Wilkinson, it is said, in reading a
poetical description of the ancient city, was singularly
impressed by its name, and by the fact that there was
a fountain of mythological origin just beyond its
walls, from which sprang clear and salt water.</p>
<p>At a meeting held to decide the matter, he among
others eloquently discussed his choice, and it was
unanimously accepted. At this time, the government
official at Syracuse had charge of such vast communications
from "Uncle Sam," that when the Post Office
was transferred later to the office of John Durford,
printer, Mr. Wilkinson carried the entire concern,
"mail matter, letter bags and boxes on his shoulders!"
Still, when the Marquis de La Fayette visited Syracuse,
five years later, it had made such rapid advancement
that it called forth his warmest congratulations. On
this occasion, truly a great one among the city's records,
her founder and benefactor, Joshua Forman, was chosen
to express the gratitude of her people. It must have
been a pleasant moment for the brave General and a
proud one for the Syracusans when, in response to their
hospitality, he returned Mr. Forman's courtesy in the
following words: "The names of Onondaga and Syracuse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
in behalf of whose population you are pleased so
kindly to welcome me, recall to my mind at the same
time the wilderness that, since the time I commanded
on the Northern frontier, has been transformed into
one of the most populous and enlightened parts of the
United States; and the ancient Sicilian city, once the
seat of republican institutions, much inferior, however,
to those which in American Syracuse are founded
upon the plain investigation, the unalloyed establishment
of the rights of men, and upon the best representative
forms of government. No doubt, sir, but
that among the co-operators of the Revolution, the
most sanguine of us could not fully anticipate the
rapidity of the improvements which, on a journey of
many thousand miles—the last tour alone from Washington
to this place amounting to five thousand miles—have
delighted me; and of which this part of the
country offers a bright example. Be pleased to accept
my personal thanks and in behalf of the people
of Onondaga and Syracuse to receive this tribute of
my sincere and respectful acknowledgments."</p>
<p>Could the Marquis have lived longer, and made his
tour hither at this time, he would scarcely have found
words to express his surprise. Perhaps no city in
New York has made such great strides in so few
years.</p>
<p>Handsome buildings have sprung up on all sides,
each one adding to the sightliness of the place; and
on the surrounding hills wealthy residents have built
their charming homes. The University of Syracuse,
a Methodist institution, built upon one of these hills
in 1870, looks down invitingly upon the knowledge-seekers
of the city, and with the State Armory,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that stands in the park near Onondaga Creek,
would furnish a brilliant equipment for some modern
Minerva, were she to visit this interesting namesake of
Sicilian Syracuse.</p>
<p>To the stranger looking out for characteristics, the
Salt Works are the most prominent among them. The
sheds stretch along like enormous stock-yards at one
end of the city, but looking into them one discovers
great vats and troughs filled with salt in every stage
of evaporation. There are two ways by which the
article is manufactured, one by solar and the other by
artificial heat, with thirty or forty companies employing
their chosen method.</p>
<p>Another striking feature is the unusual number of
public halls. This is due to the central location which
makes Syracuse a favorite point for conventions. It
was my pleasure to lecture in one of these, "Shakespeare
Hall," on my first evening in the city, where I
was introduced by General Augustus Sniper. After
this engagement, I went by rail to Buffalo, on business
connected with my proposed lecture in that city, and
returned the following afternoon. This was very unusual,
as it was contrary to the practice of my journey
to avail myself of the railway under any circumstances.
My advance agents having completed preparations for
my lecture at Rochester, I made arrangements to resume
my journey on the following day. My short
stay here gave me another opportunity to look
about this interesting town, and to realize its charms
at the prettiest season of the year. Some have believed
that its situation, importance and beauty would
win for Syracuse the honor, so long bestowed upon the
good old town on the Hudson, of being the capital of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the Empire State. Whether or not it will ever be
known as such, it will receive the flattering acknowledgment
of being one of the loveliest cities in New
York.</p>

<h3>SYRACUSE TO ROCHESTER.</h3>
<h4>Twenty-sixth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Camillus House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Camillus, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>June Third</i>.</div>
<p>Mounted in front of the Vanderbilt
House, Syracuse, at four o'clock in the
afternoon. A large number of friends
and acquaintances had assembled to see
me off, among them many G. A. R.
comrades, including General Sniper and
Captain Auer; the latter a companion
in Libby Prison during the late war.
Thomas Babcock, who had been acting
as an assistant to my advance agents, accompanied
me as far as Geddes, and arranged to co-operate
with my brother and Mr. Farrington in preparation
for my lecture. In passing through this little
suburb of Geddes, whose name by the way, keeps in
memory one of the prominent men of Onondaga
County, my attention was drawn to a fine building
standing on a hill, overlooking Syracuse. I learned
that it was the New York Asylum for Imbeciles and
that the site, a magnificent sweep of upland, measuring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
fifty-five acres, was donated by the city. I was
stopped just west of here by a thunder shower and took
refuge under a tree. <i>Paul</i> and I had waited for storms
to pass over before, and made excellent rainy-day
friends. We rather enjoyed resting under some
shelter until the dust was well laid and the air freshened.
On our arrival at Camillus, myself and horse were literally
covered with mud, the result of <i>Paul's</i> fright on the
approach of a train at a point where it was impossible
to leave the turnpike. We were trotting along quietly
and had just turned a bend in the road when the quick
ear of the horse caught the distant rumbling of
wheels. In an instant he was on the alert, and when
the swift express came round the curve, made a sudden
spring to the right, leaped a rail-fence, and landed in
a bog where the mud was two or three feet deep. I
managed to keep the saddle, but could not avoid the
mire in which we had haplessly fallen.</p>
<h4>Twenty-seventh Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Jordan House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Jordan, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>June Fourth</i>.</div>
<p>By an hour's close application to my bespattered
garments, after reaching the Camillus House, I found
that I was ready to "turn in" for the night. Started
forward in the morning, the ride on this perfect June
day proving false the old saying that "Jordan is a
hard road to travel." This village was reached about
noon and I was quite prepared for the generous meal
which was placed before me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a></span></p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption21">A FLOURISHING FARM.</span>
</div>
<p>When the gnawings of hunger had been appeased I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
gave myself up to the agreeable quiet of Sunday
afternoon.</p>
<p>There was ample encouragement for such a course
in this cosy little retreat at the head of Lake Skaneateles,
for there was not a sound from store or mill while the
people were taking their Sabbath rest.</p>
<p>This brief halt in the march forward was very
agreeable, for it gave me an opportunity to try my
own powers of locomotion, so little used since leaving
Boston. It was a real luxury to stroll about the quiet
lanes, and scan the outlying fields from the standpoint
of a modest pedestrian. In the course of my rambles
I came across some photographers from Auburn who
had been taking views of the scenery about here.
Some of their pictures were excellent.</p>
<h4>Twenty-eighth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Montezuma Hotel</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Montezuma, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>June Fifth</i>.      </div>
<p>The Auburn photographers whom I saw yesterday
met me as I was riding out of Jordan, and proposed
photographing myself and <i>Paul</i>. Some time was
passed and several ruses resorted to in attempting to
quiet the restless animal, but he skilfully avoided the
camera.</p>
<p>At last some men who happened to be near offered
their assistance, and attempted to attract the attention
of the horse from a distance, by jumping up and
down in a neighboring field. <i>Paul</i> threw his head forward,
quietly and curiously watching their manœuvers.
He was evidently amused, but there was no spirit to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the picture. Unfortunately the "spirited" part of the
scene was out of range.</p>
<p>This delay for vanity's sake prevented us from
getting farther than Weedsport by noon, where a
brief halt was made for dinner. I was met here by
W. H. Ransom and the proprietor of the Howard
House of Port Byron, who came over to Weedsport
and escorted me to their village, where I had tea and
was very courteously entertained for a few hours. On
leaving Port Byron, these gentlemen rode forward
with me towards Montezuma Swamp, which lies
between the two towns. Here we parted company,
there being no reason why they should "run the
gauntlet" with me. I had heard wonderful tales of the
dreaded monsters of this swamp, who were reputed to
be the very worst mosquitoes on record, not excepting
their famous kinsmen of the Hackensack Flats, New
Jersey.</p>
<p>Unable to bear patiently the torture of my assailants
who were swarming around me by thousands, I
put spurs to <i>Paul</i>, and went through at a gallop; but
notwithstanding this attempt to put the enemy to rout,
superior numbers gave them the advantage and their
victim came out covered with scars.</p>
<p>When Montezuma was reached we were glad to rest,
for our late adventure had quite exhausted both horse
and rider.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a></span></p>

<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Newark, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>June Sixth</i>.
</div>
<p>The journey along the line of the New York Central<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
from Montezuma to Newark, was an exciting one to
me and <i>Paul</i>. I had long since learned that whenever
the route brought us in close proximity with the railroad,
the quiet pursuit of our way was often varied
by exciting moments, owing to <i>Paul's</i> suspicion of the
"iron horse." The climax of these escapades was
reached this morning, when <i>Paul</i>, becoming frightened
by an approaching train repeated the experience of three
days ago by plunging into a slough, about two miles
from Newark, and completely covering himself and
rider with mud. When I had recovered sufficiently
to realize the situation, my thoughts were not as
amiable, I fear, as those of Bunyan's good Christian,
tried in like manner. The "slough of despond" was
so very literal in this case.</p>
<p>I had made every effort to control the excited
animal, but found the attempt useless; and I verily
believe if he were between the infernal regions and a
coming train, he would choose the former at a bound.
It was rather trying to appear before people of the
town in such a lamentable condition, to say nothing
of the discomforts arising from damp clothing; but
there was no alternative, so I followed my course;
the unfortunate victim of circumstances.</p>
<h4>Thirtieth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Fairport House</i>,     </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Fairport, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>June Seventh</i>.</div>
<p>Resumed march at eight o'clock in the morning, but
the weather was so oppressively warm and sultry, that
I was obliged to wait over from noon until six o'clock.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Riding in the cool of the day was much more agreeable,
yet, notwithstanding the physical comfort, I
must confess that the lonely and unknown road gave
rather a gloomy forecast to my thoughts. Beside
this, I found some difficulty in obtaining necessary
directions, and lost the chief charm of the journey—a
view of the beautiful country through which I was
passing.</p>
<p>It had not been my intention to do any travelling
after sundown unless the heat made it absolutely
necessary, but in this instance I felt justified in changing
the original plan. Moving along through the
unfamiliar scenes, I missed the pleasant coloring of
woods and fields under the broad light of day, the
noisy hum the sunshine calls forth, and the sound of
the birds, always the sweetest music to me. Instead
of these there was the mystical silence of night,
broken only by the clatter of <i>Paul's</i> hoofs over the
dusty road. Four hours' steady travel brought us in
sight of the straggling lights of the little post-village
of Fairport, where we stopped for the night. Found
several Rochester papers awaiting me here, which contained
pleasant reference to my proposed lecture at
Corinthian Hall.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>FOUR DAYS AT ROCHESTER.</h3>
<p>Anticipating rain during the forenoon
and fearing that my journey
might be interrupted in consequence,
I started at an early hour on the morning
of June eighth from Fairport, and
riding at a brisk pace came into
Rochester at eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>Just before reaching the city, a halt
was made at a little hamlet, two or three
miles out, for the purpose of treating <i>Paul's</i> back.
Heretofore the necessity of meeting my lecture
appointments along the route had given me no
opportunity to attend to the painful bruise, although
I had been studying the various modes
of treatment recommended by veterinary surgeons
from the time I left Boston until now. The
peculiar nature of my journey gave me an excellent
opportunity to follow this especial course, and I felt
confident of my ability to do all that was possible for
my faithful horse, yet at every stopping-place some
kindly disposed admirer of the horse had some favorite
prescription which he had found a never-failing
cure for the particular affliction that daily confronted
me. The enterprising little hamlet in question had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
its famed savant, who thought it would be highly
imprudent of me to proceed farther without his
advice—and a bottle of his "Seven-Sealed Wonder."</p>
<p>Anxious to make Rochester at the earliest moment
possible, I had no time to discuss the merits of this
great elixir, so, noting the price on the face of the
bottle, I handed this modest disciple of Æsculapius
the amount due, although he generously protested, and
congratulating myself upon being the most highly
favored traveller between Boston and San Francisco,
rode away.</p>
<p>On a hill just beyond the village and well out of
sight, I came upon an old barn standing to the left of
the road, on whose front I noticed a huge door with a
knothole in the centre. Now was my opportunity for
unsealing the "Wonder." In an instant I brought
<i>Paul</i> to a standstill and rising in the saddle, tried my
luck. The "Wonder" fell short of the mark, but it met
a resistance from the old door which effectually tested
its powers, and in my humble opinion placed the good
doctor high up in his profession. This momentary
diversion over, I again resumed the march, vowing
that this would be my last experiment with "sealed
wonders" and that hereafter I would confine my
treatment to battling <i>Paul's</i> back with warm water
and castile soap, whose virtue I had learned in the
cavalry service during the war.</p>
<p>Found that the Rochester papers had been discussing
my military record before my arrival, and that
the <i>Express</i> and <i>Sunday Morning Times</i> had upheld
my cause against the <i>Union</i>, which had ventured some
falsehoods on the ground that my "youthful appearance"
belied my experience as a soldier. With this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
pleasant criticism came another greeting from the city
press. It had been announced that I would probably
arrive at the Osburn House at four in the afternoon,
hence it was not strange that my sudden appearance at
an earlier hour caused some surprise and led to the
impression that I had come forward by rail, and that
my horseback journey was possibly not an entirely
genuine affair. I may add that it had not occurred to
me that my trip across country was of sufficient importance
to warrant any criticism upon my methods
so long as I met my lecture appointments promptly.
The sharp comment had no more serious result than
that of increasing the lecture receipts in the cities
which followed.</p>
<p>My tenth lecture was delivered in Corinthian Hall,
at the usual hour in the evening, the introduction
being made by Colonel J. A. Reynolds.</p>
<p>Next day, June ninth, gave me an opportunity to
look up the familiar places and to note the changes
that had occurred since my last visit to the city.
The cleanliness and beauty of the streets, now in their
summer glory of tree and flower, made such a tour of
inspection anything but unpleasant.</p>
<p>East avenue, where the "flour and coal kings" are
at home, is an attractive place in which to see individual
taste carried out in architecture and horticulture.
Down town, where the "kings" are at work, there is
a brisk activity which pervades everything, like an
unending accompaniment to the Falls, whose sounds
always mingle with those of the busy life around
them. Perhaps it was this continual encouragement
from the river, offered to her early pioneers, that has
given Rochester such a notable career and made her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the metropolis of the Genesee Valley: for with that
first mill-wheel set into the stream by old "Indian
Allen," the faithful waters have kept up a continual
flow of good fortune.</p>
<p>Her characteristic enterprise, milling, begun by
this same Allen, has been an unfailing source of
wealth; the golden grain with almost magic transformation
filling the coffers of her merchants and
giving her the security that a healthy financial condition
brings. Besides this, she owes much to that
liberal-minded gentleman, Colonel Nathaniel Rochester,
who came with his family from Maryland
when the settlement was in its infancy, and made his
home in "the pleasant valley." It is amusing to
fancy the unique procession, headed by the Colonel
and his sons on horseback, that started out towards
"the wild west" in the summer of 1802. There
were carriages for the ladies and servants, and wagons
for provisions and household goods, stretched out in
formidable array: for railroads were out of the question
then.</p>
<p>We hear that the travellers met with cordial hospitality
at the villages and towns along their route, and
that their arrival created quite a sensation. In fact it
was an historical event. Two friends of the Rochesters,
William Fitzhugh and Charles Carroll, cast in
their fortunes with them, and in 1802 bought together
the three hundred acres at the Upper Falls, which
were laid out for a settlement ten years later. In
those times the prestige of a name went far towards
establishing a reputation, and the one chosen by the
people of the settlement was afterward proudly placed
upon the municipal banner. Soon after the advent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of Colonel Rochester and his friends, the scheme for
making a water communication between the Lakes
and the Sea began to be eagerly discussed, and there
were not a few energetic representatives from "Rochesterville"
who lent their efforts towards the carrying out
of the plan. When the canal was completed there
was the wildest enthusiasm in Rochester, which would
perhaps have a greater benefit than any other place
along the route: for with her big grain and coal interests,
her future prosperity seemed assured.</p>
<p>The natural course of events followed. Improvement
and embellishment began on all sides. New
buildings and enterprises started up on solid foundations,
and provision was made for those who
might "drop out of the ranks," in the selection of
beautiful Mount Hope, one of the loveliest cemeteries
in point of natural charm in this country. It lies on
a wooded slope between the lake and the city, and its
pathways, shadowed by the great trees from the "forest
primeval," are the playgrounds for the wild little
creatures who make their homes there unmolested.</p>
<p>Back again into the town where the sound of the
Falls is heard, and one thinks of the odd touch a simple
character has added to the traditions of the place, and
whose name, to a stranger, is so often associated with
that of Rochester. This quaint figure is none other
than "Sam Patch, the jumper," who met his fate by
leaping into the Genesee at the "Falls," and who left as
a legacy the warning maxim, "Be careful, or, like
Sam Patch, you may jump once too often." History
has chronicled Sam's last speech, delivered from the
platform, just before his fatal leap; which, as a sample
of rustic oratory, is amusing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>He said: "Napoleon was a great man and a great
general. He conquered armies, and he conquered
nations, but <i>he couldn't jump the Genesee Falls</i>.
Wellington was a great man and a great soldier. He
conquered armies, and he conquered nations, and he
conquered Napoleon, but <i>he couldn't jump the Genesee
Falls</i>. That was left for <i>me</i> to do, and I can do
it, and will."</p>
<p>Rochester, the capital of Monroe County, New
York, was first settled in 1810, and incorporated as a
city in 1834. It is situated on both sides of the
Genesee River, seven miles from Lake Ontario, two
hundred and fifty miles from Albany and sixty-nine
from Buffalo by railway. An aqueduct of stone carries
the Erie Canal across the river, the cost of which
amounted to over half a million dollars. The city is
well laid out with wide and handsome streets, lined
with shade trees.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption23">
<img alt="VIEW OF ROCHESTER." height="262" src="images/illus-171.png" title="VIEW OF ROCHESTER." width="450" id="id-5809288870005333908">
<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption23">VIEW OF ROCHESTER.</span>
</div>
<p>Within the city limits the Genesee undergoes a
sudden descent of two hundred and sixty-eight feet,
falling in three separate cataracts within a distance of
two miles. The roar of these falls is heard continually
all over the city, but no one is inconvenienced by
it in the slightest degree. The cataracts are believed
to have formed, at one time, a single fall, but the different
degrees of hardness of the rocks have caused
an unequal retrograde movement of the falls, until
they have assumed their present position. At the
Upper Falls, the river is precipitated perpendicularly
ninety-six feet. It then flows between nearly perpendicular
walls of rock, for about a mile and a quarter to
the Middle Falls, where it has another descent of twenty-five
feet. One hundred rods below, at the Lower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Falls, it again descends eighty-four feet, which brings
the stream to the level of Lake Ontario, into which
it enters.</p>
<p>The immense water-power thus afforded in the centre
of one of the finest wheat-growing regions in the
world, with the facilities of transportation afforded by
the Erie Canal, Lake Ontario, and the several railways,
have given a vast impulse to the prosperity of
Rochester and it has, in consequence, become one of
the most important manufacturing cities in the East.
At the period of my visit, there were eighteen flour
mills in operation, grinding annually 2,500,000 bushels
of wheat. The manufacturing interests are immense—ready-made
clothing being the most extensive,
and boots and shoes ranking next. Other leading
manufactures are those of iron bridges, India-rubber
goods, carriages, furniture, optical instruments, steam
engines, glassware and agricultural machinery. Of
flourishing industries may be mentioned breweries,
tobacco factories, blast furnaces and fruit canning.</p>
<p>The largest nurseries in America are found here.
Thousands of acres within a short distance of the city
are devoted to the cultivation of fruit trees, and
millions of these trees are annually shipped to other
States and foreign countries. Over $2,000,000 is the
annual product of these prolific nurseries.</p>
<p>The city is fast becoming a great distributing centre
for coal, which is conveyed in vessels to all points on
the Great Lakes. Rochester, being the business centre
of the fertile Genesee Valley, shows a steady growth
in business and wealth. It has a magnificent system
of water-works, constructed at a cost of $3,250,000,
the water being supplied from two sources—one from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the river, which is used for extinguishing fires and
running light machinery; the other from Hemlock
Lake, twenty-nine miles from the centre of the city,
and four hundred feet above it. This water is sent
through sixty miles of mains, the pressure being such
as to throw from the hydrants a stream one hundred
and thirty feet perpendicularly. No city is more
perfectly protected from fire.</p>
<p>At the corner of Main and State streets are the
Powers' Buildings, a peculiar block of stores, built of
stone, glass and iron, seven stories high. In the
upper halls is a fine collection of paintings. A tower
surmounts the building, from which a fine view of the
city and its surroundings is obtained. "The Arcade"
is roofed with glass and numerous fine stores line its
sides. Opposite stands the County Court House, a
handsome building of gray limestone, with a tower
one hundred and seventy-five feet high. The handsomest
building in the city is, I think, the Rochester
Savings Bank, corner of Main and Fitzhugh streets.
The First Baptist, the First Presbyterian and the
Catholic Cathedral of St. Patrick are the finest church
edifices.</p>
<p>There are twelve spacious parks here, and four
elegant bridges cross the Genesee. The Rochester
University, founded by the Baptist denomination in
1850, is located on a tract of twelve acres, a little to
the east of the city. It has a valuable library and
mineralogical cabinet. The State Reform School or
Western House of Refuge for vicious boys is an imposing
edifice, containing usually about four hundred inmates.
Mount Hope, the site of the cemetery—before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
referred to—is a beautiful eminence overlooking the
city.</p>
<p>At the time of my visit, Rochester supported thirty-four
newspapers and periodicals, of which six were
dailies. The population was about 90,000.</p>
<p>It seems that Fortune has favored the "Flour
City," or at least that wise heads and generous hearts
have planned for her greatest good. It is proper to
look back into the beginnings for the keynote to success
in our American towns, and in this case, we
doubtless find it in the unselfish forethought of the
first men added to its wonderful natural resources.</p>
<p>A simple little incident, told of Colonel Rochester,
illustrates the principle, whose benefit others are reaping.
He was working in his garden one day, setting
out fruit trees, when a neighbor came along and
stopped to chat. The Colonel said: "I do not know
that I shall eat any fruit from the trees I am planting,
but as I eat from trees somebody planted for me,
I must set out trees for those who will come after
me." It was this provision for those who were to
"come after" that has done much towards making
Rochester what she is to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a></span></p>

<div class="signature1"><i>Sprague House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Churchville, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>June 12, 1876</i>.</div>
<p>I found as I mounted <i>Paul</i> at nine
o'clock in front of the Osburn House
that on this twelfth of June, 1876, my
day's ride would be a trying one on
account of the heat, but it was impossible
to change the weather and impracticable
to change my plans, so I
accepted the inevitable. As usual
through Central New York a number
of Grand Army friends and others had assembled
to see me off, and to wish me a safe journey to the
"Golden Gate." This cordiality, shown me all along
the route, took away the sense of strangeness natural
to one travelling through comparatively unfamiliar
places, and gave me an idea of the hospitality of our
American people. The pleasant good-byes over, <i>Paul</i>
and I started away in the direction of Chili, which we
reached about noon. Here I had dinner and passed
the remainder of the day, resorting again to the evening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
hours for resuming my journey; and I may add
that in this instance I found "something in a name,"
for Chili was an admirable place to keep cool in.</p>
<p>At six o'clock I started on towards Churchville,
coming in sight of its church spires a little after sunset,
and lessening the distance to San Francisco by
some fifteen miles.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the stop over at Chili, I was glad
when we came to the end of my journey, and must
confess that as I rode into the village the sight of the
Sprague House gratified me more than the view of the
picturesque town as I saw it outlined against the evening
sky.</p>
<h4>Thirty-sixth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Byron Centre Hotel</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Byron Centre, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>June Thirteenth</i>.</div>
<p>Soon after breakfast in Churchville, I threw myself
into the saddle and started for Bergen Corners, reaching
it by eleven o'clock. This distance of two miles
was covered very leisurely, for there was no pressing
engagement to fill, and I could "gang my own gait."
When there was anything to attract the eye—a sightly
field of grain, or change of scene, I usually stopped
to notice it and add one more impression to the panorama
which my overland journey continually spread
before me. At the "Corners" I spent a few hours
quietly, if I except the slight interruptions of the
landlord of the Hooper House and his family. These
interruptions for curiosity's sake were easily pardoned
by me, for anything a little humorous and
characteristic is always acceptable to one bent on seeing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
life in all its phases; and besides, the softening
influence of home-made bread and other country
luxuries, which were furnished me here, tended to
make me look charitably upon everything.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I left for Byron Centre, reaching
it at six o'clock and making eleven miles for the day.
While at supper there, the guests of the Byron Centre
House were greatly amused by two itinerant photographers
who, after their day's work was done, made a
practice of entertaining the public with fife and drum.
Through this cunning advertising scheme it was my
good fortune to see one of the most interesting crowds
that rustic America could bring together. These
enterprising "artist musicians" seemed to possess the
magic powers of Orpheus, for the villagers attracted
by their strains came flocking from every direction
and unconsciously made up a group which would
have been irresistible to a painter, and which was
certainly interesting to the ordinary observer. The
sight was an entirely novel one to me, for although
I am a New Yorker, and have seen roving concerns
of almost every description, this particular species
had never come to my notice. Through the courtesy
of Charles Leonard, the proprietor of the hotel
here, I was introduced to several Byron Centre gentlemen,
among them Rev. Edwin Allen, who called just
before my departure. Mr. Allen was most cordial,
and gave me a very clever idea of the place, and the
country adjacent.</p>
<p>Throughout my journey I was often placed under
obligations of this sort. They added to my pleasure
and increased my facilities for becoming acquainted
with the people and the country.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<h4>Thirty-seventh Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>St. James Hotel</i>,    </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Batavia, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>June Fourteenth</i>.    </div>
<p>A delightful shower of the previous evening cooled
the air, and made my journey to Batavia exceedingly
pleasant. During the day I passed some of the finest
clover and wheat fields that I had seen since leaving
Rochester. The rain may have brightened their color
and made them look their best, but regardless of this,
it is evident that the soil through this section of New
York is under a very high state of cultivation, and
signs of thrift are noticeable on every hand. I found,
as is generally the case upon approaching a town, the
farms more tastefully laid out, with their wide
stretches of wheat, and their pretty conventional
"kitchen gardens."</p>
<p>After these outskirting homes I came upon the
more dignified buildings of Batavia proper, where
push and enterprise have made some striking advances.
It is quite a business town, having its share of
manufactories, banks and newspapers, and, with its
population of something over four thousand, possessing
the benefits of a larger place. It is thirty-two
miles west of Rochester and thirty-seven east of
Buffalo. The State Institute for the Blind is situated
here.</p>
<p>In the evening I lectured at Ellicott Hall, and was
introduced by lawyer L. L. Crosby, a comrade of the
Grand Army, who, during the late war, was an officer
in the Fifth Michigan Cavalry. Among those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
called upon me at the St. James before the lecture
was Samuel A. Lester, a fellow-soldier of the Harris
Light Cavalry, with whom I talked over many of
our experiences in Company "E" of the "Old Regiment."
Nothing has been so gratifying to me in the
course of my journey, changes of scene, or new faces,
as these meetings with old comrades, and the talks of
camp and field. Separating at the close of the war,
when the trying experiences we had equally shared
had drawn us strangely together, it was natural that a
glimpse of those we had known under such circumstances
should be a delight after so many years. It gave
a different phase to my journey, too, and made it not
only a series of new and pleasant changes, but an
extended visit which might delight any traveller.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption25">

<h4>Thirty-eighth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature2"><i>Crossroads</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Near Croft's Station, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature2"><i>June Fifteenth</i>.</div>
<p>I did not find it convenient to leave Batavia until
eight o'clock in the evening, but as most of the six
miles between the two places lay through a swampy
region, I had a running fight with the mosquitoes,
which encouraged me to make good time, so that I
reached "Croft's" in an hour. On my arrival I found
Babcock awaiting me with accommodation provided
at a quiet little retreat situated at the Crossroads,
which was hotel, grocery and farm-house in one.
This odd grocery-tavern is about half a mile from the
station; just far enough away to have peculiarities of
its own. While its proprietor was throwing down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
hay for <i>Paul</i> from his barn loft, he in some way lost
his footing and fell through, but no serious damage
was done.</p>
<p>This little incident simply added an extra attraction
to the "horse that was going to California." In the
course of the morning I went to the hotel sitting-room
to make some observations and to post my journal.
While quietly occupied in this way I noticed the
arrival of several of the men and boys of the place,
who came in, seated themselves on the wooden
benches that were placed around the sides of the
room, and began unceremoniously to "look me over."
Phoebe, the proprietor's daughter, and the ruling
spirit at the "Corners," a bright little maid, who filled
the offices of cook, waitress, chambermaid and clerk,
assumed one of her various roles and was standing
behind the counter. Soon, one of her rustic knights
sauntered up to her, pipe in mouth, and called out,
"Pheeb, gimme a match!" Whereupon, her father,
who was standing on one side of the room, country
fashion, with 'trousers over his boot-tops, and in his
shirt sleeves, stepped forward and said with admirable
dignity, "Phebe, sir!" adding, as the nonplused
offender made some bashful apology, "You's brought
up well nuff, Jack, but you've forgot some on't."</p>
<p>This was an unexpected turn of affairs which I
scarcely expected to witness at "Croft's," but it at least
gave evidence of a certain sense of refinement which
we Americans would hardly be credited with outside
our cultivated circles. It afforded, too, food for reflection
upon that assumption of equality which in this
country so often tends to familiarity. We are prone
to forget that "familiarity breeds contempt."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
<h4>Thirty-ninth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Crittenden House</i>,     </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Crittenden, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>June Sixteenth</i>.</div>
<p>Started from "Croft's" at ten o'clock, stopping at the
little post village of Corfu for dinner, where I was
introduced to several people who had come together
to greet me upon my arrival. Among them were Dr.
Fuller, Dr. John McPherson and S. E. Dutton.
Dinner over, I rested until five o'clock, resuming my
journey at that hour and reaching Crittenden at six.
As I rode up to the hotel at this place I found that a
number of villagers had gathered to give me welcome,
and to learn something of my journey and its objects.
I talked to them for some time and then followed a
strong inclination to walk into the country. There
were no unusual attractions about this little village of
a hundred souls excepting the cordiality of its people
and the natural attraction that there always is about a
small community in the midst of thriving acres. To
one who has been "a country boy" himself, these
things never lose their charm, and he will give them
the preference, I think, to the finest sights in town.</p>
<p>They recall a certain old home somewhere, long
since abandoned for the charms of Vanity Fair, or a
quaint little "school house" where he first began to
think about the great world beyond. They form,
too, the resting-places in the ascent of the hill of life,
from the vantage-ground of which we may review
our progress since those early days.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>
<h4>Fortieth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>American House</i>,     </div>
<div class="signature1"><span class="smcap">Lancaster, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>June Seventeenth and Eighteenth</i>.</div>
<p>My ride from Crittenden to this place, a distance of
ten miles, was made in easy time owing to the oppressively
warm weather; for my only aim was to reach
my destination in season to meet my lecture appointment.
Found the farmers along the route still working
out their taxes on the public roads, which were
greatly in need of attention. Speaking to them as I
passed along I found that they looked rather curiously
at the strange horse and rider, doubtless wondering
whence we came and whither we were bound.</p>
<p>Addressed my Lancastrian audience in the Methodist
Episcopal Church in the evening, Captain G. S.
Remington introducing.</p>
<p>Early in the morning I had found, upon going to the
stable, that <i>Paul</i> was badly cut, and there was much
speculation as to how and by whom the injury was
done; but it was generally conjectured that he had had
a battle with a horse belonging to the landlord, during
the night. This horse, which was a large and powerful
stallion, had recently been shod, so that in the matter
of equipment he had a decided advantage over "<i>Paul
Revere</i>," who was possibly not averse to celebrating
the anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill.</p>
<p>The day following my arrival at Lancaster being
Sunday, Captain Remington called for me in the
morning, and I accompanied him to the Presbyterian
Church.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<p>As we passed along on our way to church, I had a
good opportunity to see this little town on Cayuga
Creek, and the added advantage of a personal account
of the place from one of its residents. Like all
towns adjacent to a large city, Lancaster has a certain
air of independence, and unmistakable signs of contact
with greater forces; and besides its pretty homes,
some of them the out-of-town retreats of Buffalo
business men, it has its share of industrial enterprises.</p>
<p>Altogether, it is a pretty little neighbor of which
any city might be proud, and which in its peace-loving
way is very sensible in standing off at a distance from
its busier sister. A few minutes by rail can take its
thousand and a half inhabitants "to town," where
they find the best that the great stores provide; and a
ride of a few minutes more brings them out of the
noise to their own quiet haven.</p>
<p>It is hard to realize a more delightful and thoroughly
restful existence than that found in suburban
villages, where the influences of active forces are felt,
but where they cannot disturb the even tranquillity.
They seem to illustrate the "golden mean" which
Horace recommends, and I find that it is always
pleasant to reach such places and hard to leave them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>THREE DAYS AT BUFFALO.</h3>
<p>An hour's ride from Lancaster, on the
morning of the nineteenth, brought to
view the motley array of chimneys
and towers that overtop the "Queen
City of the Lakes." While making
my way towards them, and receiving
first impressions, my attention was
attracted by a brigade drill on the
parade ground, which I halted to witness.
This was the first instance during my journey
in which I had encountered any considerable body of
military men, with the exception of the Grand Army
procession at Utica, on Memorial Day. The marching
and manœuvres evinced close attention to tactics
and excellent discipline, and the equipment of officers
and men reflected much credit upon the Empire State,
which has every reason to be proud of these her
citizen-soldiers.</p>
<p>Drill over, I rode on into Buffalo, and, soon after
registering at the Tift House, had the pleasure of
meeting Major John M. Farquhar, who introduced me
to my audience at St. James Hall in the evening.</p>
<p>Major Farquhar is a comrade, prominent in G. A.
R. circles, and was then commander of the leading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
post of the city. From him I learned something of
the changes which had taken place since my last visit
here, and which I was desirous to see as much of as
circumstances would allow. Buffalo has a peculiarly
rich history, and, like the old towns of the Mohawk
Valley, the romantic view which Indian life and love
have given.</p>
<p>Near here the arrogant Eries held their councils,
and deliberated upon the downfall of their powerful
neighbors of the Five Nations; who, in turn, ruined
and almost exterminated them. The chronicles tell
us that the Iroquois, coming by invitation to engage
in friendly contest on the hunting-ground of the
Eries, soon discovered the real intent of the wily
"Cats," who were jealous of the renown of their red
brothers. Failing in the games they had themselves
proposed, and blind with rage, they saw their tolerant
guests depart with the trophies of victory. No sooner
were they out of sight than a council of war was held,
and a decision to conquer them agreed upon. The
war bonnets were donned, the dog sacrificed, and
every preparation made for a raid into the enemy's
country; but a Seneca woman who had been taken
prisoner by the Eries some years before, apprised
the great chiefs of her nation of the intended attack.</p>
<p>In this way the Eries were in turn surprised and
defeated in their last game with their rivals. Only a
few of their warriors were left to bear the hateful
news to the women and old men who were waiting in
the wigwams: and these with their allies, terribly
punished as they had been in the encounter, were
driven by their infuriated enemies beyond the Mississippi.
The Senecas, who proudly called themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the western gate-keepers of the "Long House," made
a settlement near Buffalo, to which they gave the
musical name of Te-you-seo-wa, the place of basswood,
having found there huts covered with basswood
bark, the remnants of some lately abandoned village.
This settlement was not as near the lake-front as the
city now is, but was cautiously laid out farther back
from shore to prevent surprise. Here the young
braves found a favorite hunting-ground, and were
wont to conceal themselves near the salt springs that
bubble up from the border of the creek, to await the
buffaloes, which came there in herds. There has
been some dispute as to the naming of the city, and
the possibility of the American bison having frequented
this part of the country, but it is generally
believed that herds of these herbivorous animals did
graze on Eastern soil, and that the attacks of carnivorous
beasts and the constant warfare waged against
them by the Indians drove them to the Western
plains.</p>
<p>Nearly two centuries ago, when the site of the
present city was still a wilderness through whose
tangled labyrinths Indian eyes peered out over the
gleaming waters of the lake, La Hontan penetrated
these western wilds, and suggested to his sovereign
the building of a fort here, as a safeguard against the
Iroquois.</p>
<p>We see almost instinctively the scenes which he
saw as we follow him through lake and stream—the
great falls sparkling beneath an August sun, their
wild surroundings unmarred and untrodden save
by moccasined feet; the rapids and then the river,
to whose current, farther up, he trusted his boat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
But it was not until long after this that the sound of
the woodman's axe was heard in the forests at the
foot of Lake Erie, when the pioneer had come to
make his home, and to lay the foundation of a future
city.</p>
<p>One after another crude cabins were raised, and in
turn were replaced by more comfortable houses, so
that in 1813 the settlement was large enough to make
quite a bonfire for the British and their dusky allies.
The events which took place at Buffalo, connected
with this war, were singularly exciting; and, although
there were brave hearts and stout arms ready to defend
their country, we cannot but regret the peculiar
circumstances which led to the general havoc here.</p>
<p>Historians have gleaned such glowing descriptions
from those who were either witnesses or participants
in these stirring scenes, that we cannot fail to be
moved by them.</p>
<p>The night surprise, in the woods, near Black Rock,
when the American troops were suddenly greeted by
ambushed Britons: the rout which followed when
the terrified horsemen dashed back in retreat through
the ranks of the infantry, demoralizing them in turn,
is so vividly drawn that it has the reality of later times.
Afterwards when the alarmed people heard the cry
that the British were coming, and we see them in confused
masses trying to escape with their household
goods, we sympathize with their terror as they saw in
the distance the dreaded Indian jogging towards them
with club and hatchet.</p>
<p>It was then that Job Hoysington, who was with
one of the retreating parties, lingered behind his companions,
saying that he would have "one more shot at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the Red Skins." He evidently did have the coveted
chance, and so did the enemy, for when the snow
melted in the spring the brave fellow was found with
his empty musket at his side, and a bullet through
his brain. The work of vengeance had been completed
with the scalping-knife. At the corner of Main and
Niagara streets an old twelve-pounder stood. As the
imposing column of British infantry were advancing
upon the town, a patriotic citizen had the gun
mounted and two shots fired into the ranks. He
afterwards met the enemy with a flag of truce—a
handkerchief tied to his cane—and requested a halt.</p>
<p>This was granted, and a parley begun, while the
townspeople were escaping.</p>
<p>The firing of the houses and the plundering of
them by the Indians followed. Buffalo rose, however,
from her ashes full of new life and ambition, and
much improved in appearance. Her firesides were
again the scene of happy security, and her women,
lately fugitives, fleeing in terror from fire and sword,
were again the social inspirations of a thriving community.
More than this, they were contributing to
the enterprises of the city, for in 1821 between three
and four thousand yards of cloth were woven in the
homes of Buffalo!</p>
<p>The Erie Canal being completed in 1822, and commerce
beginning in earnest, no doubt took away from
the importance of the spinning-wheel and loom, for
these busy little machines of the past have been stored
away in the garrets long enough to make them well-seasoned
relics. Housewifely attention at this time
had to be turned to the management of larger establishments,
for Buffalo had far outgrown her infancy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and was assuming certain new conceits in architecture,
although she has never equalled the splendor of other
large cities in her public buildings. The new City
and County Hall approaches more nearly to the
modern idea, and is very attractive within and without.
It is built of Maine granite in the form of a
double Roman cross, and is surmounted by a lofty
tower bearing four symbolic figures. With the increase
of canal and railroad traffic, the building of the
immense grain elevators, which are a striking feature
of Buffalo, was commenced.</p>
<p>Their number and size have been increased to such
an extent that they almost make a town in themselves
and are capable of accommodating eight million
bushels of grain. The incessant work of storing and
transferring is carried on about these wooden giants
day after day, sometimes to the extent of more than
three million bushels, while, at their feet, boats come
and go in the great commercial game of "give and
take." There is every facility for carrying on a trade
of this kind, for Buffalo River is navigable for
more than two miles from its mouth, which is protected
by breakwaters which form an excellent harbor,
while there is a water-front on the lake and the Niagara
River five miles long. In 1869, the United States
Government began the construction of an outside harbor,
by building a breakwater 4000 feet long fronting
the entrance of the Buffalo River.</p>
<p>Overlooking Buffalo River stand the office buildings
whence come the calculating and controlling
influences that keep in "clock work" order this mart
where grain is "received, transferred, stored and forwarded
with greater dispatch than in any other port of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the country." Beyond these, in the heart of the city,
are the retail and wholesale stores, where not only
Buffalo finds her wants supplied, but numberless
sister towns; and owing to her close proximity to the
great coal region of Pennsylvania, she has very cheap
fuel, which, no doubt, is a convenient item when a
"cold wave" comes across the lake. Her iron
works, reputed to be the largest in the country, add to
her general good fortune by putting within easy access
the necessary stoves.</p>
<p>Besides all this material comfort, the climate is
extremely healthful, and the location of the city such
as to make clean, wide streets a possibility.</p>
<p>There are several of these lined with handsome
residences, and adorned with parks, which are wisely
thought to be an indispensable luxury.</p>
<p>In the midst of the business hurry there are several
quiet corners where one may quench his thirst for
knowledge, and where master-thinkers lend their
potent influence. One of these is the Grosvenor
Library, the munificent gift of one of Buffalo's pioneers.
It is admirably arranged for convenience and
comfort, and has a pleasant outlook over a little park
between Washington and Main streets. The Library
of the Young Men's Association, although containing
nearly twice as many volumes as the Grosvenor, is not
so largely frequented, but is, nevertheless, a great
resort for readers. There are also a number of smaller
libraries, where eager minds may have their fill of
books.</p>
<p>Here and there about the city one finds the familiar
evidences of Christian thought and work in the
beautiful tower-capped churches, each with its own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
varied attractions. St. Paul's Cathedral—Episcopalian—a
handsome structure of brownstone, ivy-grown
and picturesque, from whose walls in summer comes
the sound of birds, lies almost centrally among a hundred
others, and not far away is the Roman Catholic
house of worship, the dignified bit of Gothic architecture
which they have named St. Joseph's.</p>
<p>One of my favorite haunts here is the quiet, carpetless
"Historical Rooms," from whose walls the Indian warriors
who helped make Buffalo's history look down in
unchanging stolidity. Not least among these is Red
Jacket, who forms such a striking figure in the city's
traditions. An amusing incident which his picture
recalls is that of Lafayette on his return from his Western
tour in 1824. Among the preparations that were
being made for his reception was the guarding, by an
especial committee, of their "aboriginal lion," who
was a trifle too fond of his "firewater" and who was
to be the leading orator of the day. When the appointed
time arrived, so the story goes, the sachem
was led upon the platform in all his conscious dignity.
A long conversation between him and the great
Frenchman followed, through an interpreter, whom
Red Jacket employed upon formal occasions; in the
course of which the Indian complimented the General
upon his youthful appearance. "Time has left you a
fresh countenance, and hair to cover your head," said
he, "while as for me—see!" and he took off the scarf
that was wound about his own bald crown. This
provoked a laugh among the spectators who knew
that Lafayette wore a wig. When Red Jacket was
made aware of the fact, he added with ready wit that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
he too might supply himself with a new head of hair
by the aid of a scalping-knife!</p>
<p>Everything upon the walls and in the cases has
been donated by private individuals, as the society
has not yet been able to make valuable purchases,
but there is enough already to make this treasure-house
of the past interesting. Relics from pioneer
times figure largely; among the rest, arrow-heads and
tomahawks, pipes and belts of wampum, adding to the
odd collection, and suggesting all manner of horrors
to those who delight in Indian history.</p>
<p>"Forest Lawn," the place which Buffalo has selected
for her dead, is a most lovely spot, the loveliest
of its kind between Brooklyn's Greenwood and Chicago.
Everything that art could do in the arrangement
of shrub and flower has been added, and stands
as a tribute to those who are "lying low" and as a
witness to the faithful thought of the living. It is
only one of the beautiful tokens of devotion which
one sees, from the simple epitaph in a country graveyard
in the East to the solitary resting-place, high in
some tree-top of the West, where our Red Brother
"sleeps his last sleep."</p>
<p>Adjoining the Cemetery are a few acres of woodland
that have been set aside for a kind of park. On warm
summer days those seeking rest and pleasure, come to
pay their respects to Dame Nature, who makes herself
very attractive here. But this is only one, and a
comparatively small one, of the various resorts where
tired humanity may drop its burden, and roam at
will. So Buffalo has her grave and her gay side, and
her business side, which is neither grave nor gay,
making their different impressions on the traveller's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
eye, and combining, as a whole, in a very pleasing
effect. She has made and will make some very striking
changes, as all cities of consequence do; but
changes worthy of the "Queen City of the Lakes,"
who, although she may have to relinquish her title to
some outstripping sister, may always hold her head
high with conscious importance. She is still the third
city in the State of New York in point of population.</p>

<h3>BUFFALO TO CLEVELAND.</h3>
<h4>Forty-fourth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>North Evans Hotel,</i></div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">North Evans, New York,</span></div>
<div class="signature1"><i>June 23, 1876.</i></div>
<p>It had been my intention to leave the
"Queen City" on the afternoon of
the twenty-first, but I was delayed by
my advance agents, who required more
time to arrange the preliminaries of
my lectures between Buffalo and Cleveland.
Babcock went forward to Dunkirk.
Farrington to Erie, while it was
decided that my brother should accompany
me as far as Angola. There were other reasons
too, for a longer sojourn at Buffalo, as it was here I
met my wife for the last time during my journey, and
we had decided that it would be impracticable to meet
again before my return from San Francisco. While
I anticipated a pleasant and uninterrupted journey, she
had some misgivings as to my ride across the Plains,
and tried at the last to dissuade me, but I was sanguine
of the outcome and thoroughly determined to continue,
at any odds, a journey so delightfully begun. At eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
o'clock, therefore, on the morning of the twenty-second,
I returned the parting salute of my wife and
friends, and rode away. Turning into North Division
street, I went out to Main, down Main to Ohio, and
out Ohio to the Buffalo Road. Soon after passing the
city limits, I saw Lake Erie, and leaving the highway
rode down to the beach and into the water, giving
<i>Paul</i> his first drink from the great inland sea, along
whose shores we were to spend several days, and in
which I and my faithful friend would doubtless
quench our thirst many times. After this little diversion
I pushed forward for thirteen miles and a half,
which brought us to Lake View. After stopping
here a few moments I rode on to North Evans. In
this little village of something over a hundred inhabitants,
my peace was in no wise disturbed and I
was able to pass the day in comparative seclusion,
thinking over the three days at Buffalo and anticipating
the journey to Cleveland.</p>
<h4>Forty-fifth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Angola, House</i>,   </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Angola, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>June Twenty-fourth</i>.</div>
<p>The ride from North Evans to Angola was most
delightful, carrying me as it did, along the shore of
Lake Erie, which for the most part was plainly seen
from the turnpike. The exhilarating breeze from
over the water was in pleasing contrast to the intense
heat which was felt in Central New York, and
I found my appetite sharpening under its brisk influence.
The eye had a continual feast of lake and
field stretching off on either side, and as I rode along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
enjoying their diverse beauties, my only regret was
that I had no companion at this time with whom I
might share the pleasure.</p>
<p>To my right lay the shining lake, reflecting every
change of cloud and sky; in front the Shore Road,
and to my left as far as the eye could reach, rich
green fields returning the salutation of sunny June.
Easy travelling brought me into Angola in the early
morning, as it is only six miles from North Evans.
Here an unfortunate circumstance is identified with the
name of the town, owing to a serious railroad disaster
that occurred some years ago, in which many lives
were lost; but one's attention is easily diverted from
such thoughts upon entering the town. Several manufactories
give it a wide-awake tone, and keep a good
share of its five hundred inhabitants busy.</p>
<p>A small stream, known as Big Sister Creek, runs
through the place and thence winds its way to the
lake, three-quarters of a mile distant. This "Big
Sister" adds a pretty touch to the matter-of-fact little
village, while its pebbly bed is a charmed spot for
young Angolans. Soon after my arrival here, J. S.
Parker, formerly of Northern New York, called to
see me, and I discovered that he knew many of my
old acquaintances in St. Lawrence County. An hour
was spent in pleasant conversation with him, during
the course of which boyhood days at Gouverneur and
along the Oswegatchie were discussed. I strolled
about town in the afternoon, looking for "characteristics,"
and in the evening lectured in the Town Hall,
the introduction being made by Leroy S. Oatman.</p>

<h4>Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh Days.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Eastern Hotel</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Dunkirk, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>June 25 &amp; 26</i>.</div>
<p>The road between Angola and Dunkirk led me
through one of the most picturesque and productive
counties of the State, which at this time promised well
for the haymakers who were busy in their ripened
fields. Hitherto the successive and varied scenes
along my route had in turn won my admiration, from
the pleasant ride across Massachusetts and over the
Berkshires to the Mohawk Valley and Western New
York, but these grain fields in their golden harvest-time
and the glimpses of the lake which the tortuous
course of the road now and then afforded, were certainly
as lovely as anything I had seen thus far.
I had noticed that the haying season was well
advanced when I was passing through Central New
York, but owing to the retarding influence which a
large body of water always exerts over vegetation, it
had been delayed here. Fourteen miles through this
pretty section of Erie and Chautauqua counties
brought me to Dunkirk, where I lectured at Columbus
Hall in the evening, and was introduced to my
audience by Rev. J. A. Kummer. The following
day being Sunday, I had another opportunity of
meeting this gentleman, as he kindly accompanied me
in the morning to the Methodist Church, of which he
was pastor. During the services, in which I found
myself very much interested, there was an opportune
moment to study a character which I found to be a
thoroughly original one. Mr. Kummer was very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
enthusiastic about the building of a new church
which was much needed, and had been trying to
fire his parishioners with the zeal which he himself
felt. On this particular morning he made an
appeal for co-operation and funds, and then asked
for a generous offering. The good people of the
congregation had hardly warmed to the subject, and
their response was rather feeble. Another collection
was made with somewhat better results, but still the
amount was not raised by half. At last Mr. Kummer,
who no doubt believed that the end justified the
means, faced his people and said playfully, yet with
evident determination, "Now I am going to order
the doors bolted, that none may leave the house until
this matter is settled!" In less than ten minutes the
two thousand dollars necessary was obtained by donation
or subscription, and the zealous clergyman looked
down upon his people in happy approval. The scene
was the most unusual one of the kind which I had
ever witnessed, and I was tempted to applaud the
generalship which won the situation. Dr. Kummer
afterward gave me quite a lively description of his
field, in which he had become much interested.</p>
<p>Lying on rising ground just within a little bay, at
whose western extremity a lighthouse stands, Dunkirk
forms a natural port of refuge in bad weather,
and although in comparison with Buffalo its commercial
importance seems rather insignificant, there is quite a
brisk trade carried on by ship and by rail. Three
lines centre here, connecting it with the East and
West, and with the coal and oil regions of Pennsylvania,
while the incoming and outgoing vessels are
continually plying back and forth with their valuable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
cargoes. In fact, as I soon discovered, my clerical
friend was not too severe in demanding a sum for his
new church which the people must have been well
able to contribute.</p>
<h4>Forty-eighth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Minton House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Westfield, New York</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>June Twenty-seventh</i>.</div>
<p>Continued on the Shore Road from Dunkirk,
having left that city at ten o'clock in the morning.
While stopping a few minutes for dinner at Fredonia,
a pretty little village three miles from Dunkirk, I
saw for the first time during my journey quite extensive
vineyards. The region is famous besides for its
garden seeds, hence the people have their share of
fruit and vegetables. Found the farmers of this
entire section largely engaged in fruit culture, which
seems to be a very successful enterprise. Apples
and grapes are sent away to other points, and no
doubt supply in a measure the breweries and distilleries
of Dunkirk. In looking at the handsome vines
already borne down by heavy burdens, the thought
occurred to me of the corrupt uses to which they
would be put, and the havoc they would bring into
human lives. The great bunches, not yet ripe, but
promising a splendid harvest, looked tempting
enough to one who had only seen them on fruit
stands, or in market thrown together in unartistic
confusion.</p>
<p>Reached Westfield in the evening, having made
twenty-two miles for the day. Owing to my late<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
arrival, I saw very little of the place, but understand
that it has quite large manufacturing interests,
a lively trade, two good schools for its young people:
and that unfailing sign of prosperity—a newspaper.
I recalled here, another Westfield, many miles away in
Massachusetts, which I passed early in May. The two
places appeared as unlike as possible, which was due,
no doubt, to one being in the "Bay," and the other
in the "Empire" State, which some travellers will
concede makes quite a difference.</p>
<h4>Forty-ninth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Haynes House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">North-East, Pennsylvania</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>June Twenty-eighth</i>.</div>
<p>Rode away from Westfield at ten in the morning,
halting just beyond the village at the pretty home of
W. N. Allen, where I passed a very pleasant half-hour.
While looking after the interests of a large
farm, Mr. Allen and his family were very much
interested in art matters, and showed me several valuable
paintings which they had recently purchased.
I was delighted to find such refinement and taste, for
one is apt to believe that where people are not in
direct intercourse with congenial elements, they are
apt to lose their interest in the arts. As I looked
over their well-kept acres, and model buildings, I
thought of the influence such lives must exert over
the community in which they are passed. On my
way toward North East, I passed again through a fine
fruit region, stopping for dinner at a little hamlet
known as State Line.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 260px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption28">
<img alt="A COTTAGE ON THE HILLSIDE." height="450" src="images/illus-211.png" title="A COTTAGE ON THE HILLSIDE." width="260" id="id-6575961435872848992">
<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption28">A COTTAGE ON THE HILLSIDE.</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>
<p>At first the prospects for the "inner man" looked
rather doubtful, as I came up to the solitary State
Line House, but a few moments' search brought me
to the landlord, who was hoeing in a cornfield, and
my wants were soon supplied. By five o'clock I was
riding into the borough of North-East, where I found
a number of people awaiting me. Upon dismounting,
I learned that I was announced to lecture in the
Town Hall that evening. This was a surprise, but
I was ready to comply. The village band escorted
me after supper to the hall, taking a position in
front of the audience, and giving us "Hail Columbia"
before, and "The Sword of Bunker Hill" after the
lecture. The hall was so crowded that many were
compelled to stand, and if hearty applause is an
evidence of satisfaction, I may consider my effort
to entertain the North-Easters a success. Captain
Bronson Orton, a lawyer of the place, made the introduction,
and I afterwards had a chat with him
about experiences in Georgia, as he was with
Sherman's army during its march from Atlanta to
the Sea, and was quite familiar with many of its
incidents. I too had followed the great strategist
through that State, although in a very different
capacity; it having been my lot to drop into the
rear of his conquering legions during my escape from
Southern prisons. The trying circumstances which I
passed through, when I evaded the guard at Sylvania,
the cautious tramps by day, and vigilance by night,
in the friendly swamps, came back after the intervening
twelve years, with all the vividness of yesterday.
I related my experiences with the negroes and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
meeting with good old March Dasher, who led me
rejoicing into the Federal camp.</p>
<p>None of the events of those exciting days escaped
my memory, and the chance of talking them over,
with one of the men who had been with Sherman,
was a rare pleasure. In the course of our conversation,
we touched upon Captain Orton's present home,
which is in a very pretty corner of the "Keystone"
State, and which apparently has reached the golden
mean between business and pleasure. Its residence
portion suggests ideal comfort, while its office-buildings
and stores are built upon a substantial and convenient
plan.</p>
<h4>Fiftieth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Reed House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Erie, Pennsylvania</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>June Twenty-ninth</i>.</div>
<p>Upon my arrival at Erie, I was pleasantly surprised
to find a letter from Colonel F. H. Ellsworth,
proposing to make me his guest at the Reed House
during my stay in that city. I gladly availed myself
of his kind invitation, and although my time
there was necessarily short, I had, through the
thoughtful interest of my host, every opportunity to
see the city, and to hear something of its development.</p>
<p>Through Erie, Pennsylvania comes in contact with
the great commercial interests of the Lakes, and
although she only holds a small share of the valuable
shore line, there is every advantage for reaping a
large benefit. The harbor is most perfect, being protected
by a strip of land known as "Presque Isle,"
and which, long before the persistent waves wore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
away its southern end, was connected with the mainland.
Two lighthouses stand at its entrance, and
guide the night traveller to one of the prettiest ports
in this part of the country, while from the bluffs on
which the town is built shine myriads of answering
lights. The streets are wide and regular and lead to
many handsome homes, which they say will bear comparison
with the finest on the Lakes. Several parks
relieve the monotony of brick and stone, and add to
the sightliness of the place.</p>
<p>Besides her present importance as representative of
her State on the great inland seas, Erie has had her
share on the page of history since 1795; among her
proudest annals being the departure from her port
of Oliver Hazard Perry, who went in 1813 to meet
the English in the splendid naval action which has
made his name famous. There are many memorials
of this engagement among the city's relics, which
bring back the reality of those stirring times more
forcibly perhaps than the volumes describing them.</p>
<p>Like Buffalo, Erie's leading enterprises are her iron
works, where stoves, machinery and steam engines
are made. Large quantities of coal and petroleum,
the contributions from Pennsylvania, are sent here
for shipment, and form a good share of the varied
products which make their way through the large
water channels to different parts of the United
States. Her educational system is excellent and there
are nearly half a hundred public schools, which offer
quite good advantages to the children who help make
her population of nearly twenty-five thousand. Erie
undoubtedly has a bright future before her, which her
rapid increase in population since 1870 predicts, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
she may, in a measure, balance the power in the
opposite corner of the State, where the "City of
Brotherly Love" reigns supreme. Having seen so
much of the place as time would allow, and heard its
story from those who knew it best, I ended the day
by lecturing at the Academy of Music, Hon. C. B.
Curtis introducing.</p>
<h4>Fifty-first Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Farm House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Swanville, Pennsylvania</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>June Thirtieth</i>.</div>
<p>Passed a very busy morning at Erie attending to
business correspondence with advance agents, making
notes, and with the assistance of Mr. Farrington
brought my scrap-book up to date. I called also upon
a few old acquaintances whom I had known in the East,
and whose faces were a welcome surprise at this stage
of my journey. The editor of the Erie <i>Dispatch</i>
called after dinner and spent an hour with me in a
general discussion of the incidents of my trip since
leaving Boston, which had been, however, more pleasant
than exciting. In this way the afternoon slipped
by, and it was not until five o'clock that I found
myself ready to leave Colonel Ellsworth's hospitable
roof. Had I not been fully determined to make
some headway before night, the cordial request of
my host that I stay longer with him might have
dissuaded me at the last from starting so late, but I
resisted the inclination, and having bade good-bye to
my newly-made friends put spurs to <i>Paul</i>, who soon
carried me far beyond the city limits on the road to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Swanville. I had long since learned that in a case
of this kind, the charms of hospitality, like those of
Circe, were fatal to the interests of him who heeded.
Made the eight and a half miles to Swanville in fair
time, and was soon settled for the night at the home
of John Joseph Swan, an old resident and pioneer,
after whom the hamlet is named.</p>
<h4>Fifty-second Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Farm House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Swanville, Pennsylvania</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>July First</i>.</div>
<p>Was compelled to remain in this place two days on
account of my lecture appointment for Girard, and
was singularly fortunate in having cast my lot with
the Swans, who were untiring in their efforts to make
my stay agreeable. The head of the family was
eighty-three years old and quite patriarchal in
appearance. From him I learned something of
their military record, which reaches over quite an extended
period of our country's history, and which
makes a noble background for the peace and comfort
they now enjoy. Mr. Swan's father was a captain
of militia in pioneer days, and his son Andrew was
a lieutenant-colonel of cavalry during the late war.
He was a participant himself in the war of 1812, and
both he and his father were pensioners. In fact they
have grown up with the country, having shared its
trials and its triumphs. Mr. Swan was one of the
earliest settlers in Erie County, and although more
than half a century had passed since he had settled
there, this veteran still remembered and vividly described<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the scenes and events of those stirring times.
He saw the first steamer launched on the lake and
said it was regarded as an evil omen by the Indians,
who called it "The Devil's Canoe" and who ran
frightened from the shore at its approach. His
stories were most amusing, and their personal narration
gave them a freshness which was untiring.
While I was with these people, I had the pleasure of
meeting Miss Eliza Swan, a talented daughter of
the family, who had just returned from Paris, where
she had been studying under Jules Le Fevre, the
well-known painter. Among her better productions
I was especially pleased with her portrait from life
of an old man, for which she was awarded a medal by
Peter Cooper.</p>
<h4>Fifty-third Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Central House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Girard, Pennsylvania</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>July Second</i>.</div>
<p>Took a walk with Mr. Swan over his farm in the
morning, looking at his stock and grain and quietly
admiring the thrift and enterprise everywhere apparent.
The comfort and refinement of these country
homes had made a strong impression, and I became
quite enthusiastic over the American farmer. My
host took especial pleasure in showing me the changes
which half a century had wrought upon his premises,
and which certainly were surprising. It was difficult
to realize that the fields which we were viewing had,
within the memory of my companion, been transformed
from a wilderness to cultivated acres. While<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
strolling over the farm, the sky became clouded and
by noon a torrent of rain deluged Swanville. Owing
to this caprice of the elements, I was unable to leave
until three o'clock in the afternoon. Made the six
miles and a half between the two places in easy time.
As I rode into town I was greeted by the Girard
Brass Band, which, while it amused me, rather surprised
<i>Paul</i>, who during our "triumphal procession"
to the Central House did a little "dancing," greatly
to the delight of the onlookers.</p>
<p>After lecturing at the Town Hall in the evening,
where I was introduced by Jacob Bender, editor
of the <i>Cosmopolite</i>, I was serenaded at my hotel by
the indefatigable band, which certainly made me
feel welcome. I was sorry that the limitations put
upon my time by appointments ahead allowed me so
small an opportunity to meet the people, and get a
better idea of their occupations. I should have liked
to visit the lumber and brick yards, which are the
chief enterprise, but was obliged to content myself
with only a "cursory glance," as our newspaper
friends say. The soil of the region is almost entirely
composed of clay, and is thus peculiarly adapted to
the manufacture of brick.</p>
<h4>Fifty-fourth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Fisk House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Ashtabula, Ohio</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>July Third</i>.</div>
<p>A bright sun and clear blue sky gave promise of
an exceedingly pleasant day, as I seated myself in
the saddle at Girard at eight o'clock.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>
<p>Before leaving I bade good-bye to Mr. Farrington,
who had been with me from Boston, but who now
found it necessary to return to his home at Elmira,
New York, owing to business interests there. I
regretted exceedingly his retirement, as he had rendered
invaluable service in connection with my
lectures, and had been a most genial and companionable
fellow-traveller, whenever circumstances brought us
together along the route.</p>
<p>I found the people everywhere engaged in preparations
for the Centennial Fourth, which, as it was to be
one of our greatest holidays, was to be celebrated
with unusual enthusiasm. Owing to the excitement
which prevailed, and to the fact that almost every
man and woman was employed upon some active
committee, I decided to waive my lecture at Ashtabula,
and enter into the public demonstration. The
Rev. Mr. Fisher, who had intended introducing me
to my audience at this place, came to see me at the
Fisk House soon after my arrival, and talked of the
arrangements that were being made for the morrow.
In the evening I called upon Rev. L. W. Day and
had a chat with him about Ashtabula. The town
is the capital of Ashtabula County, and lies at the
mouth of a small river of the same name, in the
midst of a good farming district. The principal
products are wheat, maple sugar and those of the
dairy. The chief interests of the town are its manufactures,
which I understand are quite important.</p>
<p>As in all such towns, the population is varied.
The combination of the farming and manufacturing
elements gives a decidedly picturesque aspect.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<h4>Fifty-fifth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Farm House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Near Painesville, Ohio</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>July Fourth</i>.</div>
<p>This day has been indeed the greatest holiday in
the history of the United States. Such grand preparations
and such lavish display have probably never
been witnessed before on this continent, and although
I chanced to be in a comparatively obscure corner of
the Republic, I found the prevailing sentiment as
deep as though I were in one of the great centres.
I doubt if there was sleep for anyone during the
preceding night, for the wildest excitement was manifested,
and the dawn of the Centennial Fourth was
presaged by the booming of cannon, the blowing of
engine whistles, the ringing of bells and discharge of
firearms of every conceivable calibre and description.</p>
<p>The townspeople were stirring at an early hour, and
although I had found very little rest, I was in the
saddle by nine o'clock. A thunder-shower overtook
me about noon, thanks to the generous use of gunpowder,
and I took shelter under a tree, from whence I
was invited to dinner by Daniel Flower, a neighboring
farmer. With him and his family I passed a comfortable
hour, and then moved forward in the direction
of Painesville.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption29">

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption29">HAYING IN NORTHERN OHIO.</span>
</div>
<p>Toward evening I reined up in front of an inviting-looking
house—a feature which the traveller
soon learns to observe—and asked one of the farm
hands if Mr. Lee was at home. Before the man had
time to answer, a young girl came running down the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
path toward the gate, saying, "Are you Captain
Glazier?" I acknowledged that I was that humble
person, whereupon Miss Lee asked me to dismount
and "come right in," while Jack would take care
of the horse. Her father and mother had gone to
Cleveland in the morning, to celebrate the Fourth,
and were expected back the same night. The little
lady insisted upon my stopping overnight, and bustled
about with all the importance of a housewife in preparing
supper. I naturally felt some hesitation in
accepting her invitation to remain all night, but she
insisted that I be her guest, and made every effort
to amuse me. After tea, I was ushered into the
parlor, where my hostess soon joined me, saying
that I was her "very first caller" and that she was
going to entertain me "the best she knew how."
Suiting the action to the word, she took her place at
the piano, and began to play some national airs suitable
to the occasion; but as the evening slipped away
I began to feel the effects of the day's ride, and
begged to be allowed to retire. This, however, the
young lady seemed at first disinclined to do, asking
me to wait for her father and mother, but finally I
insisted as gently as possible; so she showed me to
my room herself, wishing me a hearty good-night.
Dawn was ushered in by the rattling of milk pans and
the creaking of a pump under my window, so, knowing
that further rest was out of the question, I
dressed and went downstairs, where I met Mr. and
Mrs. Lee. I found them very kindly people, and
knew that their daughter had inherited from them her
share of good nature. That odd little miss was up
at the first cock-crow, and was waiting to bid me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
good-morning. As I was about to mount <i>Paul</i> after
breakfast, she asked the privilege of a ride on him,
and, bounding into the saddle, galloped down the road
with the grace of an Indian. When she bade me
good-bye at the gate, where her father and mother
were standing to see me off, she asked me in her unsophisticated
way to remember her as my "Centennial
girl," which I solemnly promised to do, and as I
looked back from the road I could see her waving
her handkerchief as a parting salute.</p>
<h4>Fifty-sixth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Farm House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Near Wickliffe, Ohio</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>July Fifth</i>.</div>
<p>Starting rather late from Painesville, a town just
beyond Mr. Lee's, and riding leisurely during the
day, I found it necessary to keep to the road until
dark, in order to place myself as near to Cleveland
as possible, before halting. Reached Willoughby, the
seat of a Methodist College, nineteen miles east of
Cleveland, just before sundown, where I was tempted
to stay over night, knowing that to ride farther would
be gloomy and uninteresting, but in my eagerness to
reach the "Forest City," towards which I had looked
for several days, I pressed forward.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption30">
<img alt="JUST OUT OF CLEVELAND." height="262" src="images/illus-225.png" title="JUST OUT OF CLEVELAND." width="450" id="id-7920793473094664112">
<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption30">JUST OUT OF CLEVELAND.</span>
</div>
<p>As there was no hotel at Wickliffe, I passed through
the little hamlet of that name and secured lodgings
at the farm house of Thomas Lloyd, an old settler of
Lake County, and a very large land-owner. He told
me the history of his pioneer life in this section of
Ohio, and of his start in the pursuit of a fortune,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
which gave me a bit of the early history of Ohio
from another standpoint. It may seem odd that during
the "flying visits" which I sometimes paid to
these small places, there was opportunity to hear anything
about them, but country folk are accustomed to
early rising, and as I learned the art, years ago, of
waking with the birds, I very often joined my host,
and had a chat with him before breakfast. The settlement
near which I stayed overnight is six miles
west of Willoughby, which brought me within thirteen
miles of Cleveland. It boasts of nothing more
than the necessary blacksmith shop and "store," and
"looks up to" its big neighbor with due reverence.
It lies in the fertile county of Lake, a northeastern
corner of Ohio, measuring some two hundred and
sixty square miles, of which a large portion is covered
with forest, and whose surface is generally hilly or
undulating.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>FIVE DAYS AT CLEVELAND.</h3>
<p>Found a good night's rest at the quiet
farm-house of the Lloyds, on the night
of the fifth, and after an early breakfast
on the following morning called for my
horse and started for Cleveland. On my
way out, near Wickliffe, I overtook a
troop of girls on their way to school.
One of them, a bright-faced little
maid, giving her name as Ettie Warren,
and saying she was a granddaughter of Mr. Lloyd,
asked me to accept a bouquet, which had no doubt
been intended for her teacher. It was a mass of
gay colors, which had been gathered from the home
garden, and its huge proportions quite appalled me.
However, I accepted it with mock gravity, and as she
and her small companions kept beside me, I could
overhear a whispered conversation of very secret import,
which resolved itself into the question, "Do you
like apples, mister?" I confessed my fondness for
the fruit, and was soon the chagrined possessor of a
pocketful of green ones, which this sunburned little
daughter of Eve generously offered. Before riding
into town I was obliged to consign these gifts to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
roadside, but not without a certain guilty feeling, and
sympathy for the cheated school ma'am.</p>
<p>Passed through the village of Mentor, a pleasant little
place six miles from Cleveland, the home of Hon. J. A.
Garfield, then an Ohio Congressman.</p>
<p>Noting much excitement as I approached Euclid,
I dismounted to learn the cause, and found it was due to
a rumor that General Custer and his entire command
had been massacred by Indians. The source of this information
made it appear reliable, and yet comparatively
few were disposed to believe it. My long association
with the General during the War of the Rebellion
led me to take the thought of his death very much to
heart, although I was yet unwilling to credit what I
had heard. At the Forest City House, whither I had
been escorted by a delegation of G. A. R. friends, the
truth of the report was discussed, and the deepest
regret manifested, should such a fate have befallen the
brave cavalryman.</p>
<p>In the evening I lectured at Garrett's Hall, where
Major E. M. Hessler introduced me. Later, in behalf
of a number of citizens, the Major proposed a banquet
in my honor, but this I felt justified in declining,
owing to imperative duties in connection with my journey.
The rest of my time here was passed in looking
about the city, and in talking with some of the "Forest
City" people, who are pardonably proud of their
home on Lake Erie. This part of the State was a great
hunting-ground for the Indians in former days, who
came to make war on the bear and beaver. They
started eastward in the autumn and paddled down
the lake, entire villages at a time, to the mouth of
the Cuyahoga River, on whose banks they piled their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
birch canoes and then scattered through the neighboring
forests. Returning in the spring to a small cabin
which had been built near their landing-place by the
Northwestern Fur Company, they disposed of their
spoils, and when their business with their white
brothers was over, re-embarked for their summer
homes on the Maumee and Sandusky.</p>
<p>When General Moses Cleveland came with a surveying
party in 1796 to lay out the site of the chief
city of the "Reserve" for the Connecticut Land
Company, the cabin of the fur-traders was still standing,
but was in too dilapidated a condition to be of
use. Two more cabins were therefore raised, one for
the party, and the other for Job Stiles, and his wife
Tabitha, who was housekeeper. When the plans
were finished the woman of the settlement found herself
the possessor of one city lot, one ten-acre lot, and
one one hundred-acre lot, a donation from the directors
and stockholders of the company, made no
doubt in consideration of her services, and from the
fact that she was the first white woman to take up her
abode on the new ground. Two more gifts of the
valuable land were made, one to Nathaniel Doane, the
company's blacksmith, who had kept their pack-mules
shod, and the other to James Kingsbury and his wife,
the first who emigrated independently to the Reserve.
Within eighty years the worth of this property had
increased surprisingly, but the first owners had long
since ceased to care for worldly goods, and the land
had been resold many times. Buildings that would
have astonished those early folk had replaced their
simple cabins, and thousands of strange feet were
treading in their old haunts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<p>For several years, in fact until the opening of the
Ohio Canal in 1834, the population of Cleveland increased
very slowly. A year after the survey, the
homes "under the hill" along the right bank of the
Cuyahoga had to be removed to the ridge, for even at
that time fever and ague began to trouble the settlers.
This disagreeable malady, wittily personified as "Ague-agueshakershake,"—the
God of Lake Erie—was a
continual bugbear and made yearly attacks upon
the families. So widespread was the reputation it had
gained that a stranger stopping at Buffalo, then a rival
port, was told that if he went to Cleveland he "would
not live over night." On the highlands the exposure
was much less, and soon all the cabins were built
there. Then they began to spread out along the ridge
toward the east, in the direction of Euclid, following
the line of the Euclid Road, which even then was a
popular place on which to have a section and build.
In 1801, the first well in Cleveland was dug on this
thoroughfare, and was walled in with stones which
the Indians had left from their wigwam fireplaces.
Two years later Connecticut ceded her Western Reserve,
which she had held under an old charter, to the
General Government and the chief city transferred
her allegiance to the new State of Ohio.</p>
<p>Gradually the settlement spread out into the surrounding
country, where ambitious hamlets, having
enjoyed their brief season of independence, ultimately
cast their fortune with the larger city, and became
a sharer in its triumphs. One of these, which
had attained more importance than the rest, had
started up on the opposite bank of the Cuyahoga, and
assumed the bravado of a rival. Cleveland made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
several advances to her which were met with coolness,
and at last both villages applied for charters; the one
on the left bank receiving hers first and glorying in
her new name of "Ohio City." Again Cleveland besought
a conciliation and tried to persuade the independent
little rival neighbor to change her name, and
become one with her, but with ill success. As time
wore on, however, population decreased on the left
shore and increased on the right, and signs of union
became apparent from the fact that "Ohio City"
reached out to the southeast, while Cleveland met her
half-way by extending toward the southwest. We are
not sure how matters were arranged between the two
rivals when the final step was taken, but at any rate it
was a felicitous event, and now that the coveted
neighbor has become the West Side, some Clevelanders
find it difficult to determine which is the
"better-half."</p>
<p>In those early days before the railroads reached her,
this new Ohio town was obliged to look about for
other means of transportation, and we hear of one of
her pioneers establishing a boat yard in the woods a
mile and a half from the lake. Here the engineer
cut his timber and carried out his plan for the first
boat built at Cleveland. The framework was raised
in a clearing of the forest, from whence a rough road
led to the water, and in this wild but convenient spot
the schooner was finished, and ready to be introduced
to the world as "The Pilot." The farmers of the
surrounding country were invited to assist in the
launching and accordingly came into town on the all-important
day, with their oxen, to haul the craft down
to the shore. The ceremony was greeted with resounding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
cheers, and Levi Johnson received his first
congratulations from his fellow-townsmen. This was
in 1814. He afterwards built a steamboat and gave
it the name of one of his own characteristic traits,
"Enterprise."</p>
<p>In 1816, although the itinerant preachers who had
visited the place would scarcely have credited it, a
church was organized and an Episcopalian form of worship
established, which later grew into Trinity Church
and Parish. Hitherto a bugle had called the people
together when a clergyman appeared, and the most
primitive services followed. On one of these occasions,
well-known to those who lived in Cleveland
when it was still a churchless community, Lorenzo
Dow was announced to preach. He was an eccentric
man and the place reputed to be a bad one. His congregation,
who were waiting under a large oak, did
not recognize the solitary figure approaching in his
shirt sleeves, and, as he quietly sat upon the ground
in their midst, and his head dropped upon his knees in
silent prayer, one in the crowd enquired if he were
Lorenzo Dow. Some one answered, "Yes," but another
irreverently said in an undertone, "It's the devil."
Dow overheard the remark, and rising, preached to
his hearers such a sermon on Gehenna that they never
forgot it, or him.</p>
<p>In 1821, the "Academy" became an institution, and
began a course of instruction upon a very liberal
basis, giving its pupils the full course for four dollars
a term, and separate branches for much less.</p>
<p>In the year 1836 the city was incorporated, and
with the new honor seems to have looked to the improvement
of her appearance. The public square,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
which had previously been little more than a grazing-place
for cows, was seriously considered as a possible
ornament, and was graded and made more attractive,
until now it bears little resemblance to the common
on which the irrepressible Indian, "Omic," breathed
his last. It has changed its name since then, and has
become "Monumental Square," from the marble statue
of Commodore Perry, which adorns its southeastern
corner. A good view of the liveliest part of the city
can be had from here, and from early morning until
late at night there is a continuous stream of people
passing through it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a></span></p>

</div>
<p>Superior street, which forms its southern boundary,
is lined with retail stores, and its fine buildings and
neat pavements hardly suggest the indifferent houses
and plank road of forty years ago. Ontario is
another busy thoroughfare running north and south,
and bisecting the square. Where it begins, at Lakeside
Park, it is lined with private residences, but beyond
the square it develops into a genuine work-a-day
business street. In 1813 there was a small stockade
on the lake shore just below it, for Cleveland
was a depot for supplies, and was waiting to give a
warm reception to the English. Most of the public
buildings are on or near the square—the Post Office,
Custom House, City Hall, and several of the
churches. Not far away is the library of the Young
Men's Literary Association, which has had a singularly
favored career. Established in 1845 upon a
very unpretentious basis in the Case Building, it was
soon given a perpetual lease by the owner, and later
received a large sum of money for its extension and
support from a son of Mr. Case. The Public Library<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
is located in the old High School Building on Euclid
avenue and has 26,000 volumes in circulation. The
Board of Trade is another of the city's time-honored
institutions, having been founded in 1848. It is now
in the Atwater Building on Superior street.</p>
<p>Euclid avenue, which from its rustic popularity in
pioneer days, came to bear the proud distinction of
being one of the handsomest streets in the world,
stretches off eastward from the square, for four and a
half miles, until it reaches Wade Park, a beautiful
spot, still shaded by the groves and forests which have
been left from the wilderness. It was a gift from Mr.
Wade, one of Cleveland's millionaires.</p>
<p>From this point the avenue continues for a mile
and a half until it finds its terminus in Lake View
Cemetery, a magnificent stretch of woodland overlooking
the lake from a height of two hundred and
fifty feet.</p>
<p>The avenue is in its entire length a feast of beauty.
The homes that line it on either side are fine specimens
of architecture, and the gardens surrounding
them show a lavish devotion to the sweet goddess
Flora. Thousands of people who are unable to leave
town during the summer find a grateful change of
scene here, and it so impressed Bayard Taylor that he
bestowed upon it the splendid praise of calling it the
most beautiful street in the world. Nor is its charm
purchased at the expense of squalid surroundings, for
the streets of Cleveland are well kept and almost all
of its homes have their little gardens around them, while
the tenement house is "conspicuous by its absence."
In fact the people have chosen rather to sacrifice a
trifle more to time and expense and less to space.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
They have expanded and have built longer street-car
lines in proportion.</p>
<p>The old eyesore of dilapidated huts and rubbish
heaps along the river and lake shore was soon swept
away after the railroads came, and a fine park substituted.
The undertaking was a large one, but it
proved to be well worth the labor and money expended
upon it, and is now one of the city's chief adornments
and one of her most delightful rendezvous.</p>
<p>The stranger, as he nears the "Forest City" wearied
with his travels and sensitive to his surroundings,
finds nothing to meet his curious gaze but a neat shore
line on one side, and on the other the green slope of
Lakeside Park, with its grottos and fountains, and an
occasional suggestion of graveled walks. The top of
the ridge is an excellent place whereon to take a
morning stroll, and get a good breath of fresh air, and
from this eminence the lines of the five railroads which
centre here can be seen converging towards the Union
Depot, where a large portion of the coal, petroleum
and lumber is received that makes its way from distant
points.</p>
<p>"The Flats" along the lake and river fronts are
alive with business, and present a fascinating scene
from some overlooking point. There are factories, ore
docks and coal and lumber yards famous the country
over, and water craft of every kind and size. One of
the most important enterprises is that of the Cleveland
Rolling Mill Company, whose buildings occupy thirty-two
acres, and whose yearly pay-roll reaches more
than $2,000,000. On the West Side is the Cuyahoga
Steam Furnace Company, noted for having manufactured
a patent horse-power cannon for the Government,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and for having turned out the first locomotive
in the West. The great Standard Oil Company, begun
in the sixties and later developing into a stock company
under its present name, is located here, and its
cars, surmounted by the familiar white keg, are seen
on almost all the railroads of the country.</p>
<p>Out from the river's mouth stretch two long piers,
two hundred feet apart, which represent the final
triumph of the engineer over the tides which have
wrought such incessant mischief ever since a certain
captain and his crew were delayed in the harbor of
Cleveland sixty years ago by a sandbar. There is a
lighthouse at the end of each pier, and one high up on
the shore which was built by the Government in 1830
at a cost of $8,000.</p>
<p>Now, through this inviting gateway, large lake
boats steam into port without hindrance, bringing
with them the rich copper and iron ores of Lake
Superior, the limestone of the Lake Erie Islands, and
the miscellaneous products which they take up along
their route. With these valuable cargoes, to which
have been attributed much of her prosperity, Cleveland
receives a large amount of coal from the mines
of Ohio and Pennsylvania, having access to the latter
through the Ohio Canal, which has been such an impetus
to her growth.</p>
<p>On the other side of the river are her large Water
Works, the incessant pumping of whose engines supplies
this city of 140,000 inhabitants with water.
The Reservoir lies upon the top of a cliff, and is a
favorite resort in summer. From its crest a fine view
of lake and river can be obtained, and if one were to
allow his imagination a little freedom, this would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the most satisfactory place to get a retrospective
view of Cleveland as it was to the pioneer. About
here the Indians stayed unmolested long after they had
sold their land to the white man, and across the river
on the slope the first log cabin stood. The scene which
takes its place is almost bewildering with its network
of factories, lake and river craft and housetops. Here
and there a dot of green rises above the buildings, betraying
the presence of the elms and maples which
have been jealously preserved and which are one of
the characteristic beauties of the "Forest City."</p>
<p>During my stay here, nothing was more gratifying
than a walk or ride through the broad streets in the
shade of these trees. It made summer in the city
something to stay for, and not something to run away
from. There were many drives leading out beyond
the limits daily frequented by pleasure-seekers, and
inviting out-of-the-way places for those who were
unable to go elsewhere. Beside these, the lake,
though the shallowest in the chain and sometimes
treacherous on that account, is a continual clarifier and
beautiful to look upon. As for the old-time "God,"
and his attendant maladies, who tyrannized over the
pioneer, they seem to have vanished, and now I venture
to say there is no healthier city in the country
than Cleveland and certainly none more attractive.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a></span></p>

<p>At eight o'clock, my favorite hour for beginning
a day's ride, I mounted <i>Paul</i> in
front of the hotel at Cleveland, but before
leaving the city I stopped at Major Hessler's
office to hand him the proceeds of
my lecture at Garrett's Hall, which were
donated to the Soldiers' Monument Fund
at Dayton. This brought me two very
kind acknowledgments: one from General
James Barnett, who forwarded the money, and the
other from Rev. William Earnshaw, custodian of the
Monument Fund. These letters, written in behalf of
three thousand disabled veterans, amply satisfy me
for any sacrifice I may have made, and are among my
most prized possessions. General Barnett wrote as
follows:</p>

<p>There are certain results following every undertaking
which are looked upon either with gratification
or dissatisfaction, and which, through side issues, very
often assume the importance of those desired to be
attained. The recollection of the splendid scenes
through which I have passed, the people whom I have
met, the cities I have visited, will be a lifelong
satisfaction, but the opportunity to help perpetuate
the memory of fellow-soldiers and to do others honor
while they yet live, will be the most gratifying outcome
of my journey. Knowing this, the following letter
from Chaplain Earnshaw holds an important place
among the papers of my correspondents.</p>

<p>On leaving the city several gentlemen gave me the
pleasure of their company for some distance, among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
them Alexander Wilsey, who before the war had been
a scholar of mine back in Schodack, New York.</p>
<p>Meeting him was only one of many similar experiences,
for here and there along my route I found
old acquaintances, whose faces I had never expected to
see again.</p>
<p>After a ride of six hours, I rode into Black River
and found it quite an enterprising village, but hardly
suggesting its old position as the principal port in the
county.</p>
<h4>Sixty-second Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Huron House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Huron, Ohio</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>July Twelfth</i>.</div>
<p>Left the aspiring village of Black River or "Lorraine,"
as the inhabitants are disposed to call it, at
nine o'clock, stopping at the Lake House, Vermillion,
for dinner. The scenery is very attractive along the
Lake Shore Road between Black River and Huron,
and I followed it all day and for two or three hours
after nightfall, covering a distance of twenty miles.
My sense of the beautiful was somewhat dimmed,
however, by the cloud of mosquitoes which beset my
path, and which were hardly persuaded to part company
at the hotel. There were nearly seven hundred
people in Huron, and I must confess that upon entering
the slumbering village I began to be generous in
the hope that my attentive little tormentors would
adopt the principle of equal distribution among the
inhabitants. But for the rapacious mosquito the course
of the traveller by night upon these highways is serene
and uneventful, for, of all the hordes of wolves, wildcats,
buffaloes and panthers that made their homes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
about this part of the country in the times of the Indian,
scarcely a vestige remains.</p>
<p>The race of the red man is becoming slowly exterminated,
and his friends of the forest seem to be disappearing
with him, while the white man and the mosquito
fill their places. I am sure no one of average reason,
especially our logicians of New Jersey, would deny
that this is another proof of the survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>Although it was dark before I came into Huron, I
could get a very good idea of its character, and had
formed some notion of the place which was to shelter
me. In 1848 it was spoken of as having been
"formerly the greatest business place in the county,"
and this reputation, although it has not made it a
Sandusky or a Cleveland, has left it a spark of the old
energy.</p>
<h4>Sixty-third Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>West House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Sandusky, Ohio</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>July Thirteenth</i>.</div>
<p>I was fortunate in having a comparatively short
distance to travel between Huron and this city. It is
only nine miles, and I did not start until two o'clock,
allowing myself a two hour's easy gallop with the
lake on my right all the way.</p>
<p>Along this shore more than a century ago, General
Bradstreet, with three thousand men, sailed to the
relief of Fort Junandat, while Pontiac, the great Ottawa
warrior, was besieging Detroit. Reaching Fort
Sandusky he burned the Indian villages there and destroyed
the cornfields; passed on up to Detroit to
scatter the threatening savages, and returning went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
into the Wyandot country through Sandusky Bay.
To have attempted to ride alone on horseback in those
days would have been a foolhardy, if not a fatal
undertaking. Now the screech of an engine-whistle
announced the approach of a train on the Lake Shore
Road, the great wheels thundered by, and <i>Paul</i>, alert
and trembling, was ready to dash away. How different
it would have been in those old pioneer times!
The horseman would have been the one to tremble
then, his hand reach for his rifle, his eyes strained
towards the thicket from whence the expected yell
of the savage was to come.</p>
<p>Among the first proprietors of this section were the
Eries. These were followed by the resistless Iroquois,
and after them the Wyandots and Ottawas, who seem
to have left the strongest impress upon the hills and
valleys of Ohio. One of these tribes, the Wyandots,
called the bay near which they built their wigwams
Sæ-san-don-ske, meaning "Lake of the Cold Water,"
and from this the present name of the city comes. In
the early days it was called Ogontz, after a big chief
of that name who lived there before the year 1812.
All about were rich hunting-grounds, which accounts
for its having been chosen by the Indians in times of
peace; and even now Sandusky is held to be one
of the greatest fish-markets in America.</p>
<p>The place was bound to be attractive to the white
man, and any one might have safely prophesied that a
city would rise here. The ground slopes gradually
down to the lake, the bay forms an ideal harbor, and
looking off upon the boats and water, the eye rests
upon a scene picturesque and striking.</p>
<p>My attention was called to Johnson's Island, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
was used for the confinement of Confederate officers
during the late war. I learned that they were allowed
the luxury of an occasional bath in the lake,
under guard, of course, and in squads of a hundred
men—a luxury which the boys in Libby and Charleston
and Columbia would have thought "too good to
be true."</p>
<p>Under the city are the limestone quarries, which
furnish an inexhaustible supply of building-material
and which give an added distinction to this bright
little city of the lakes.</p>
<p>On the evening of my arrival I spoke in Union
Hall and was introduced by Captain Culver, who referred
to my military record and the object of my
lectures. Captain Culver is a comrade in the G. A. R.
and was a fellow-prisoner at Libby and other prisons.
He did much towards making my stay at Sandusky
most agreeable.</p>
<h4>Sixty-fourth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Fountain House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Castalia, Ohio</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>July Fourteenth</i>.</div>
<p>My Sandusky friend, Captain Culver, called at the
West House for me soon after breakfast, and we spent
the forenoon strolling about the city. I was shown
the newly completed Court House, of which Sanduskians
are very proud; met several of the officials
and found much to admire. Left at five o'clock
in the afternoon and by six had reached Castalia, five
miles distant, which I soon found had something to
boast of back of its classic name. As a stranger I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
was of course immediately told of the wonders of the
"waters," which I learned form quite an attraction in
summer and keep the little place in a flutter of excitement.</p>
<p>Marshall Burton came in 1836 and laid out this
prairie town at the head of Coal Creek. Finding the
source of the stream in a cool, clear spring, now known
to be two hundred feet in diameter and sixty feet
deep, named the place "Castalia," from the famed
Greek fountain at the foot of Parnassus. The waters
of this spring are so pure that objects are plainly seen
through the sixty liquid feet, and they say that when
the sun reaches meridian, these objects reflect the
colors of the rainbow, which might suggest to Castalians
that the ancient sun-god, Apollo, favored the
western namesake of his Delphian fount. I met no
poets here, but possibly inspiration is not one of the
powers guaranteed. Indeed if it should treat devotees
of the Divine Art, as it does everything else that is
plunged into it, we should have petrified poets.</p>
<p>These petrifying qualities of the water, caused by the
combined action of lime, soda, magnesia and iron have
made the mill-wheels which turn in Coal Creek incapable
of decay.</p>
<p>At a little distance from the town is a cave of quite
large dimensions, which was discovered accidentally
through a dog running into the opening in pursuit of
a rabbit. This cave I believe makes up the complement
of natural attractions about the village. The
chief attraction, the social life of the people, cannot be
guessed at by the rapid glance of the traveller. But
even a short sojourn here is apt to be remembered
long and pleasantly. Ohioans are notably hospitable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>
<h4>Sixty-fifth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Ball House,</i></div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Fremont, Ohio,</span></div>
<div class="signature"><i>July Fifteenth.</i></div>
<p>I was awakened at twelve P. M. the previous night
at Castalia by two villainous imps, who seemed
determined to make an impression. Their evident object
was "more rum," which to the credit of the landlord
was not furnished them. Exasperated by this
temperance measure, they attempted to enter the house,
and finding the doors locked began a bombardment
with fists and feet. This novel performance was kept
up until the object of their wrath and his shot-gun appeared.
Owing to this my ride of nineteen miles to
Fremont was not as refreshing as it might have been.</p>
<p>As I approached the town I thought of President
Hayes, who is so closely identified with it. Here he
began the practice of law, and won such popularity, not
only among his townsmen, but throughout the State,
that in 1864, after a succession of honors, his friends
were pushing him for Congress. In answer to a letter
written from Cincinnati, suggesting that his presence
there would secure his election, he said, "An officer
fit for duty, who at this crisis would abandon his post
to electioneer for Congress, ought to be scalped. You
may feel perfectly sure that I shall do no such thing,"
and in a letter to his wife, written after he had heard
of Lincoln's assassination, he expressed another sentiment
quite as strong when he said: "Lincoln's
success in his great office, his hold upon the confidence
and affection of his countrymen, we shall all <i>say</i> are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
only second to Washington's. We shall probably
<i>feel</i> and <i>think</i> that they are not second even to his."</p>
<p>Fremont of course is justly proud of the name and
fame of Rutherford B. Hayes. Two years before he
returned to his home, after refusing Grant's offer of
an Assistant Secretaryship, but the people of Ohio
were not satisfied with this. Their feelings were
probably voiced by the words of a personal friend
of Hayes, who said: "With your energies, talents,
education, and address, you are green—verdant as
grass—to stay in a country village." Soon afterwards,
at the urgent and repeated requests of the
people, he gave up his quiet life and once more entered
the political arena, with results which the election of
1876 shows.</p>
<p>There were apparently many who were dissatisfied
with the Nation's choice, but in Ohio, and especially
where he was known personally, he was much beloved
and admired. His uncle, Sardis Birchard, who died
some years ago, leaving his property and fortune to his
namesake, has given a park and a fine library to Fremont.</p>
<p>The town is on the Sandusky River, at the head of
navigation, and has quite a brisk trade for a place
claiming only a little over five thousand inhabitants.</p>
<h4>Sixty-sixth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Elmore House,</i></div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Elmore, Ohio,</span></div>
<div class="signature"><i>July Sixteenth.</i></div>
<p>My accommodations at the Ball House, Fremont,
were quite in contrast with those placed at my disposal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
at Castalia. I heard no stories of "mineral
springs" or wonderful freaks of Nature, but shall remember
Fremont as the delightful little city where I
had two nights' sleep in one.</p>
<p>I began my day's journey at eight o'clock with
Elmore as the evening objective. Halted a few
moments at a hotel known in that locality as the Four-Mile
House. Took dinner at Hessville, where I remained
until four o'clock in the afternoon and then
rode on to Elmore.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>FIVE DAYS AT TOLEDO.</h3>
<p>Ordered <i>Paul</i> and saddled him myself
at Elmore, on the morning of July seventeenth.
In fact it was my usual custom,
while riding through the rural districts, to
personally groom, feed and care for my
horse, as I learned soon after leaving
Boston that, unless I attended to his
wants myself, he was most likely to be
neglected by those in whose hands he
was placed, and from a selfish standpoint, knowing
also the importance of keeping him in the best possible
condition, I never overlooked anything which was
likely to add to his comfort.</p>
<p>On my way from Elmore, I stopped for lunch at a
country grocery, hotel and saloon, four miles from this
city. A small piece of bread, a bowl of milk, and a
few crackers covered my refreshment at the "Jack
of All Trades," as upon asking for a second piece of
bread I was informed that I had just eaten the last in
the house. There being no further appeal, I remounted
and rode off in the direction of Toledo, where
I lectured in the evening at Lyceum Hall, under the
auspices of Forsyth Post, being introduced by Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
J. T. Woods, a surgeon of our Volunteer Army during
the late war, and now an active comrade in the
G. A. R.</p>
<p>Doctor Woods and I had a long and animated talk
at the Boody House over old times, and especially of
Custer, who was greatly admired by both of us, as he
was by every one who knew anything of him. Doctor
Woods had collected a number of articles referring to
the General which he thought of especial interest,
among others the following lines which seem to bear
the very impress of Custer's martial spirit:</p>
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The neighing troop, the flashing blade,</span><br>
<span class="i1">The bugle's stirring blast.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The charge, the dreadful cannonade,</span><br>
<span class="i1">The din and shout are past.</span><br>
<span class="i0">No war's wild notes nor glory's peal</span><br>
<span class="i1">Shall thrill with fierce delight</span><br>
<span class="i0">The breast that nevermore may feel</span><br>
<span class="i1">The raptures of the fight."</span>
</div>
<p>When our conversation turned upon Toledo, it became
more cheerful. The city, after having survived
many reverses of fortune, is now on the eve of rapid
development, and can hardly be said to have a rival
in Northern Ohio. The long and hard battle fought
for the soil on which it now stands is almost forgotten,
and instead of arousing the interest of the
stranger with thrilling tales of massacre and war, the
Toledoan now points to the emblems of peace.</p>
<p>Not so far away but that the patriotic citizen may
become familiar with the place is the old battle-field
of "Fallen Timbers," where "mad Anthony Wayne"
brought the Indians to bay, and having conquered,
pursued them for ten miles along the Maumee, until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
he reached Swan Creek, now in the centre of the
town.</p>
<p>This battle is one of the most dramatic in the records
of Indian warfare. It was at a time when the Wabash
and Miami tribes had refused to accept any overtures
from the Americans, and when they were determined
to fight out their cause with the help of the
British.</p>
<p>Knowing that pacific measures were then superfluous,
and that the matter must be decided by war,
Wayne at the head of a splendid support, marched to
the Maumee, erected Fort Defiance at the junction of
the Au Glaize, and then proceeded to a point where
he knew the forces of the enemy were concentrated.
The place was in every way favorable to the party in
possession—the river on the left, heavy thickets on
the right, and in front natural breastworks formed by
fallen timbers, the result of a tornado. Into this trap
it was necessary to march in order to meet the foe.
Wayne's simple plan of attack was this: to rouse
the savages from their lair with an irresistible bayonet
charge, "and when up, to deliver a close and well-directed
fire on their backs."</p>
<p>The result was a victory for the Americans. The
Indians and their white allies, completely routed, made
a precipitous retreat, leaving the battle-field covered
with their dead. Hotly pursued, their cornfields
and wigwams destroyed on the way, they were finally
ready to acknowledge that peace was better than
war. So ended the great battle of the Maumee,
one of the most fatal in its effect upon the destiny of
the red race.</p>
<p>It was after this, when actual contest was over, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the Indians had been provided for west of the Mississippi,
that the Cincinnati Company laid out a town
on the present site and called it Port Lawrence,
after the famous flag-ship in which Perry met the
British on Lake Erie. Later, Major Stickney, a historic
pioneer, whose sons, "One" and "Two" Stickney
are equally immortal, laid out Vistula, which afterwards
joined Port Lawrence, under a name destined to
become a power in the State—Toledo.</p>
<p>The fortunes of the new town were fluctuating as
April weather, and the faith of property-holders must
have grown weak through wavering. Most of these
hard times were due to malaria, which was bred in
the neighboring swamps and forests, and which was an
ever-present menace; yet when the cloud of contention
lowered over the tract of land lying between the
territory of Michigan and the State of Ohio, Toledo,
the very centre of the trouble, being claimed by both,
was animated enough, although her neighbor, Monroe,
was wont to vex her with such taunts as this:</p>
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The potatoes they grow small, on Maumee,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And they eat them, tops and all, on Maumee."</span>
</div>
<p>Potato-tops must have possessed singular virtue, for
there was no want of spirit when the test came "On
Maumee."</p>
<p>The "Toledo War," much talked of and laughed
over in its day, is passing slowly into oblivion, and
now only an occasional grey-beard brings its scenes
back with amusing reminiscence. The cause of the
trouble lay in a mistake of Congress, which established
an impossible boundary line between Michigan
and Ohio, so that the "bone of contention" was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
tract of land eight miles wide at the western end,
and five at the eastern, which both claimed. The
people living in this tract were therefore between two
fires, some preferring to be governed by the laws of
the territory, and the others giving their allegiance to
Ohio. The respective governors were the principals
in the quarrel, and showed a strong disposition to
fight, while the chief executive at Washington, being
unable to interfere, was obliged to assume the role of
a spectator, advising, however, that the interested
parties defer action until the convening of Congress.</p>
<p>The advantages were pretty evenly divided, except
that Michigan, as a territory, in attempting to prevent
the State from enforcing her supposed right, aroused a
strong State pride among the "Buckeyes." The militia
was called out on both sides and Michigan
threatened with arrest those who should attempt to
re-mark the boundary line—the compliment being
generously returned by Ohio.</p>
<p>In the midst of these hostilities the Legislature of
Ohio created a new county, calling it Lucas, after the
Governor, which included a portion of the contested
territory, and had for its seat the town of Toledo. To
hold court at this county-seat without the intervention
of the authorities of Michigan would virtually decide
the case in Ohio's favor, but how this bold <i>coup d'etat</i>
was to be accomplished, and on the date appointed—the
seventh of September—was a question that puzzled
the Governor himself. General Brown, in charge of
the Michigan militia, was reported to be in Toledo at
the time, with a force twelve hundred strong; while
Colonel Vanfleet, the Ohio warrior, was to rely upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the stout hearts of a hundred men, who were to act as
<i>posse</i> for the protection of the court.</p>
<p>When the judges, sheriff and attendants met at
Miami to perfect their plans, on Sunday the sixth of
September, they were somewhat fearful of the issue,
and finally left the decision of the matter in the hands
of Colonel Vanfleet. This intrepid Leonidas immediately
assumed the championship of his State with
admirable skill, and, walking up and down, sword in
hand, in front of his hundred followers, for a moment's
meditation, turned at last to the judges with these impressive
words:</p>
<p>"If you are women, go home; if you are men, do
your duty as judges of the court. I will do mine. If
you leave this matter entirely with me, I will be responsible
for your safety and insure the accomplishment
of our object; but if otherwise, I can give you no assurance!"</p>
<p>In the light of present knowledge, the reader of
these words, while he respects and admires the spirit
in which they were uttered, and the man who spoke
them, cannot avoid a mild sense of amusement. But
this is not to the point. Matters proceeded seriously
on that sixth of September, 1835. Vanfleet called for
twenty volunteers, and these having quickly responded
to the call, the Colonel then informed his protégés,
probably not to their surprise, that the seventh of September
would begin immediately after midnight; that
the law did not specify any time for the opening of
court, and that if they would rely upon his protection,
they could accomplish their purpose in the face of the
foe.</p>
<p>"Governor Lucas wants the court held," he added,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
"so that by its record he may show to the world that
he has executed the laws of Ohio over the disputed
territory in spite of the vaporing threats of Governor
Mason. Be prepared to mount your horses to start for
Toledo at precisely one o'clock in the morning. I will
be ready with my escort."</p>
<p>The appointment was met, and Toledo was reached
at three o'clock. The party proceeded directly to a
school-house, and there court was held in due form of
law, its proceedings written out on bits of paper being
deposited in the tall crown of the clerk's hat. When
business was over, the entire party went to a tavern
near by for refreshments. Just as the men were about
to indulge in a second cup of cheer, some one called out
that General Brown, with a strong force, was on his
way to arrest them. Glasses were dropped, the little
matter of indebtedness to the saloon-keeper was waived
without ceremony, and a moment later not a sign of the
Ohio dignitaries remained.</p>
<p>When they had placed a sufficient amount of the contested
soil between themselves and General Brown, they
halted upon a hill to fire a salute, but at that time it was
learned that the clerk's hat, containing the all-important
papers, had been knocked off his head by the limb of a
tree during the retreat. To return might mean capture
and the failure of their plan. To abandon the recovery
of the missing hat would be equally deplorable. Vanfleet
accordingly sent back a small detachment to search
the road; "the lost was found," and, at last triumphant,
a loud salute was fired. To say that the men did not
then let the grass grow under their feet is but a mild
assertion. It has been said by good authorities, that if
the retreating party had charged General Brown's regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
with half the force they employed in getting
away, they could have routed a force twice its size.
When Congress convened, however, they had the satisfaction
of having a favorable verdict pronounced upon
their "unlawful act, lawfully committed," although
Jackson had previously expressed himself in sympathy
with the cause of Michigan. The defeated party, to
even up matters, was given the northern peninsula
between Superior and Huron, now her richest section.</p>
<p>During the course of the "war" Toledo was full
of Michigan troops, who left many anecdotes behind
them and whose generally harmless behavior raised
many a laugh among the townspeople. As one of
these stories goes, Major Stickney, walking out into
his garden one morning, noticed something that
looked like a human figure in his potato vines. He
called out to the mysterious object and asked what
was going on there? The call brought to his full
length a soldier in uniform, who stretched up and replied:</p>
<p>"Drafting potato-tops to make the bottoms volunteer,
sir!"</p>
<p>And so, half in jest, and half in earnest, the affair
continued and ended.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a></span></p>

</div>
<p>When the forests were cleared away and the
swamps drained, the dread malaria partnership was
dissolved; good health brought good cheer, and prosperity
followed. Very soon after the trouble with
Michigan, the Miami and Erie Canal was built, which
has been one of the important factors in making the
"Corn City" so strong commercially. Besides this
great inland water-way, eight railways bring into her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
marts the products of the rich farms of Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan and Ohio.</p>
<p>From her ports enormous quantities of grain are
yearly shipped to England either direct, or <i>via</i> Montreal,
and her people say, without expecting to be
contradicted, that no city in the United States can
point to such a wonderful development of commercial
resources. This scarcely suggests the time when Toledo
was little more than the dead carcass of speculation,
the prey of the tax-gatherer, waiting the resurrection
that followed the War of the Rebellion, when
men remained her citizens simply because they had no
money with which to get away.</p>
<p>Commerce takes the lead here, but there is one enterprise
of which Toledoans seem to be even prouder,
and to see which they take the visitor "whom they
wish to impress with their greatness." This is the
thriving and truly imposing Milbourn Wagon Works,
put into operation in 1875 and already become famous.
The brick buildings are unusually fine and, architecturally,
would leave the uninformed stranger under
the impression that they might belong to some institution
of learning.</p>
<p>I was enabled to see more of the city than I had
expected, owing to an unforeseen circumstance. A
little friend who lived in Detroit, and who was dying
with consumption, had expressed a wish to come to
Toledo to see me and my horse before it was too late.
I therefore remained longer than I intended, that her
friends might bring her down by boat, although they
hardly hoped that she would survive the journey.
She was given the pleasure of a quiet trip to Put-in-Bay,
the well-known resort, and with this and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
gratification of seeing <i>Paul</i>, in whom she was deeply
interested, her visit ended.</p>
<p>Of all the strangers who come to this bright and
busy city, active with the impetus given it by fifty
thousand souls, I doubt if any take more keen delight
in looking upon its business enterprises and individuality
than did this bright-minded girl, just about to
relinquish her hold upon earth. She knew nothing
of the dark pages in its history, and only guessed at
the wealth and strength back of the thronged harbor.
To her it was a happy place—the temporary home
of friends.</p>

<h3>TOLEDO TO DETROIT.</h3>
<h4>Seventy-second Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Erie Hotel</i>,    </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Erie, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>July 22, 1876</i>.</div>
<p>My Toledo friends were ready at the
Boody House to give me good-bye when
I mounted at nine o'clock, and I received
a right hearty send-off. Upon leaving
the city, instead of continuing westward
as usual toward the "Golden Gate," I had
determined for various reasons to swing
off from the direct course, and ride
northward to Detroit, moving thence to
Chicago. This new route would take me through
Monroe, a town with which the life of General Custer
was more closely associated than any other, and knowing
that I would find much there that would give me
a more intimate knowledge of the man, I looked forward
to this part of my journey with eager anticipation.</p>
<p>The ride to Erie being at some distance from the
lake, and over a flat region, was rather monotonous.
Erie itself is a small unimportant hamlet at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
western end of the lake, and a modest landmark in
my journey from Toledo to Detroit. <i>Paul</i>, probably
impressed with the air of peace that enveloped the
place, made up his mind upon his arrival to give the
good people a display of his mettle, and accordingly
tore through the village streets in the wildest fashion.
Having thus introduced himself, he pranced after
I had dismounted until he had had enough; then returning
to his master, his eyes seeming to flash mischief,
he looked as though he would have said, had he been
given the power of speech: "I have been having a
fine time, haven't I? and would you like to mount
me and enjoy the fun too? but I dare you!"</p>
<p>When his superabundant spirits had found vent,
I had him led away and myself attended to his wants.
Beyond this animated exhibition of my horse the day
passed uneventfully, and at night I enjoyed to its
fullest extent the quietude of a country inn.</p>
<h4>Seventy-third Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Erie Hotel</i>,    </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Erie, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>July Twenty-third</i>.</div>
<p>Weather cool and pleasant; went to church in the
morning and listened to a sermon by Rev. E. P. Willard,
on the text, "Remember the Sabbath Day to keep
it holy." Doubtless the preacher had his reasons for
bringing to the minds of the Erieans this particular
command, but judging from appearances they needed
a very mild admonition. It looked as though every
day were Sunday here.</p>
<p>A letter reached me at this point from my wife,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
full of concern as to my welfare if the journey were to
be continued across the Plains; and as she was in very
indifferent health at the time, I was about to abandon
my purpose and return. The news of Custer's tragic
death had reached the East, and my intended route
running as it did across the Indian country, filled
my friends with apprehension. Closely following this
letter, however, came another, informing me that
my wife was improving, and, with this assurance, I
decided not to turn back. By this time, the freedom
and charm of this mode of travel had aroused my
enthusiasm; the imaginary line, losing itself in the
Pacific, promised a rich experience, and the opportunity
was golden. The good news from home was therefore
joyfully received.</p>

<div class="signature"><i>Strong's Hotel</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Monroe, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>July Twenty-fourth</i>.</div>
<p>I was detained at Erie until after dinner, spending
part of the forenoon in a blacksmith shop, where
<i>Paul</i> was being shod. By two o'clock I was on the
road again, riding briskly toward Monroe, for the
weather was so much cooler than it had been during
the previous week, that I could move comfortably at a
good pace. <i>Paul</i> seemed very proud of his new shoes,
and, although I halted two or three times, covered
something over ten miles by five o'clock.</p>
<p>As I reached the outskirts of Monroe, I was considerably
surprised to find a large number of people
assembled on the picnic grounds. They were accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
by a band, and greeted me with several
national air, including "Hail Columbia" and the
"Star-Spangled Banner." The Custer Monument Association
received me at the City Hall, where I had been
announced to lecture in the evening, as it was my intention
to speak in the interest of the Fund; but the
date was changed to the Thursday following my arrival,
with a view to giving its members an opportunity
to co-operate with my advance agents.</p>
<p>Great enthusiasm was everywhere apparent, and the
people of Monroe needed no urging to lend their
patronage, when the movement was likely to reflect
honor upon their illustrious dead.</p>
<p>My emotions upon entering this town, long the
dearest place in all the world to Custer, can better be
imagined than described. That it was a favorite with
him is not strange, for aside from the tender associations
which it held for him, its pretty homes and broad
streets, deeply shaded by maples, make it a most
lovely spot and the very type of peace.</p>
<h4>Seventy-fifth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Strong's Hotel</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Monroe, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>July Twenty-fifth</i>.</div>
<p>Wrote to my mother in the morning, and after dinner
took a stroll about town. Beyond its associations with
Custer, Monroe is interesting through its connection
with one of the most romantic and sanguinary scenes
connected with the war between Great Britain and the
United States; for on the banks of the River Raisin,
which runs through it to the lake, occurred the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
famous Indian massacre of 1812. Relics of the
bloody encounter are still found on the field.</p>
<p>It was at a time when the British were making successful
inroads upon Michigan, and General Winchester,
at the head of eight hundred Kentuckians,
had been ordered to Frenchtown, the old name for
Monroe, the same point toward which General Miller
had previously moved on a mission equally fatal.</p>
<p>Winchester was warned of the advance of the
enemy, but thought there was no cause for immediate
alarm, and on the night before the engagement, he
crossed to the side of the river opposite his men,
leaving the camp open to attack. The result was, that
he awoke the next morning to find Proctor's troops
putting his men to rout, at the point of the bayonet,
while their Indian allies were adding to the confusion
by their deadly assault.</p>
<p>Although a part of the Americans escaped on the
ice of the river, the field was covered with their dead
and wounded, General Winchester being among the
former. When the engagement was over, Proctor
rode away, leaving a detachment to guard the prisoners
and wounded, with instructions that no violence
was to be committed; but some of the savages who
followed him having become intoxicated, returned and
fell upon the prisoners with unrestrained frenzy.
Most of the latter had been placed in two small cabins.
These were fired, and the victims perished in the
flames, the Indians pushing them back when they attempted
to escape through the small windows. The
remainder were massacred and their bodies left a prey
to the wolves. It was this horrible affair that aroused
the Americans and particularly the Kentuckians to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
revenge; and when Tecumseh, the Shawnee warrior,
who was the chief instigator of these atrocities, urged
the British to hazard an engagement at the Thames,
after their defeat by Perry, they prepared to return
with full interest the blow given their comrades on the
Raisin. The battle of the Thames is well known.
Tecumseh, with the war cry on his lips, met his reward
through a Kentucky bullet early enough in the
fight to be spared the shame of defeat. With him fell
a powerful foe, but one whom we must admire even in
his death.</p>

<p>Received a large forwarded mail from my advance
agents and others, which I attended to in the afternoon.
I was also favored with Detroit papers referring
to my proposed lecture in that city, and the following
notice from the Monroe <i>Monitor</i>, which, together
with letters from the Fund Association, I kept as
souvenirs of my stay at this place:</p>
<blockquote><div><p>"The lecture announced to be given for the benefit of the Custer
Monument Fund, on Monday evening, at the City Hall, was postponed
for various reasons until Thursday evening, at the same
place. On Monday evening several members of the association met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Captain Willard Glazier, and were most favorably impressed with
him. They are convinced that he is thoroughly in earnest, and that
his proposition is a most liberal one. He offers to give the entire proceeds
of his lecture to the association; and not only in this city, but
throughout the State, he generously offers to do the same thing.
This is certainly deserving of the warm recognition of our own
people, at least, and we hope on Thursday evening to see the City
Hall filled. Captain Glazier comes with the strongest endorsements
from well-known gentlemen in the East, both as to his character as
a gentleman and a soldier, and his ability as a speaker and writer.
The Captain served under the late General Custer in the cavalry,
and has something to say regarding his personal knowledge of the
dead hero."</p></div></blockquote>
<p>When I started from Boston in May, I little
dreamed that before my journey was finished the
troubles in the West with the Sioux would bring such
a result as <i>this!</i> It is true, affairs in Montana and
Wyoming territories had assumed a threatening aspect,
but no one doubted the efficacy of "Custer's luck,"
and those who followed the campaign looked upon it
as a dramatic and striking incident, rather than a
tragic one.</p>
<p>News was slow in reaching points east of the
Mississippi and was then often unreliable, so that if I
may judge from personal observation, the people were
wholly unprepared for the final result which was
flashed across the country on the fifth of July.</p>
<h4>Seventy-seventh Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Strong's Hotel</i>,     </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Monroe, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>July Twenty-seventh</i>.</div>
<p>Rose at an early hour in the morning, and was very
busily occupied during the day with correspondence
and preparations for my lecture. The people of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Monroe had asked that I would tell them something of
my experience with Custer during the late war before
beginning the lecture, as everything relating to him
was at that time of the most thrilling interest to them.
It was not difficult to comply with this request. The
old scenes of 1863 were as fresh in memory as though
they had been witnessed but yesterday.</p>
<p>My first meeting with Custer was at the third battle
of Brandy Station on the twelfth of September, 1863,
as the Cavalry Corps then acting as the advance of the
Army of the Potomac was moving toward Culpeper in
pursuit of Lee's retreating columns. Custer had but
recently been commissioned brigadier-general and this
was the first time he went into action at the head of
his brigade. His appearance was very conspicuous. A
mere boy in years, gorgeously equipped, in short, bearing
upon his person all the gold lace and other paraphernalia
allowed his rank, he formed a striking
figure—such a one as is seldom seen on the battlefield.
His arrival at Brandy Station was at a critical
juncture, and while we were momentarily expecting a
conflict with Stuart's cavalry, then directly in our
front, all had a curiosity to see how the gayly dressed
brigadier would acquit himself. It seemed to be the
general impression that he would not have the nerve to
"face the music" with his bandbox equipment, but he
soon proved himself equal to the occasion. Being
ordered to charge the enemy, he snatched his cap from
his head, handed it to his orderly, drew his sword
and dashed to the front of his brigade, then formed in
column of squadrons. The command "Forward!"
was instantly given. A moment later "Trot!" was
sounded; then "Gallop!" and "Charge!" and before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the Confederates had time to realize that we really intended
an attack, they were swept from the field, and a
section of a battery with which they had been opposing
our advance was in the possession of the young
general and his gallant cavalrymen.</p>
<p>No soldier who saw him on that day at Brandy
Station ever questioned his right to a star, or all
the gold lace he felt inclined to wear. He at once became
a favorite in the Army of the Potomac and his
fame was soon heralded throughout the country.
After this engagement I saw Custer at Culpeper and
Cedar Mountain, and in the skirmishes along the
Rapidan during Lee's retreat from Gettysburg; later,
when Lee again advanced through Northern Virginia,
at Sulphur Springs, Newmarket, Bristoe and in the action
of October 19, 1863, near New Baltimore, where
I was taken prisoner.</p>
<p>The incidents which I recalled were those of war,
but Custer's friends here gave me the incidents of
peace. Mr. J. M. Bulkley, who is perhaps more intimately
acquainted with the General's early life than
any other man in Monroe, was his old school-chum
and seat-mate at Stebbin's Academy.</p>
<p>When this institution was broken up, and its
property sold, Mr. Bulkley bought the old desk at
which he and Custer had sat, and on which as school-boys
they had cut their initials. It stands in his store,
and in it are kept all the papers relating to the Monument
Fund.</p>
<p>Custer's next experience was in the Monroe Seminary,
and it was while he was a student there that
the pretty little face of his future wife flashed into his
life. The story of this meeting is laughable and odd.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Custer, then a rough, flaxen-haired lad, coming home
one afternoon, his books under his arm, was passing
Judge Bacon's residence, when a little brown-eyed
girl swinging on the gate called out to him, "Hello,
you Custer boy!" then, half-frightened by the blue
eyes that glanced toward her, ran into the house. The
little girl was Libbie Bacon, daughter of the Judge.
It was love at first sight for Custer, and although
they did not meet again for several years, he was
determined to win the owner of those brown eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a></span></p>

</div>
<p>Having finished a preliminary course of study and
wishing to enter West Point, he urged his father to
apply to John Bingham, then a member of Congress for
the district in which Monroe was situated, for an appointment.
This his father hesitated to do as Mr. Bingham's
politics were opposed to his. The young man
was therefore obliged to rely upon his own efforts.
He called upon the dignitary himself. Mr. Bingham
was pleased with the applicant, promised to lend his
influence, and the result was that George Armstrong
Custer ultimately received a formal notification from
Washington, bearing the signature of Jefferson Davis,
to the effect that the recipient was expected to report
immediately to the commanding officer at West
Point. His course there was about finished upon the
breaking out of the late war. He went at once to
Washington, and through General Scott was launched
upon his military career. What sort of a soldier he
was the world knows. What his character was the following
incident may partially suggest. It occurred
early in the war when Custer was beginning to feel
somewhat discouraged over his affairs. He had already
done much that was worthy of promotion and, having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
a boy's pride and ambition. Fate seemed to be against
him. The clouds vanished one day, however, when
the Army of the Potomac was encamped on the north
bank of the Chickahominy near Richmond.</p>
<p>General Barnard, of the Engineers, starting out to
discover if the river was fordable at a certain point,
called upon Custer to accompany him. Arrived at the
bank of the stream, he ordered the young officer to
"jump in." He was instantly obeyed, although the
pickets of the enemy were known to be on the opposite
side, and dangerously near. Nor did Custer return,
after having found that there was firm bottom,
until he had made a thorough reconnoissance of the
Confederate outposts.</p>
<p>Upon their return, Barnard rode up to McClellan,
who was about to visit with his staff his own outposts,
and began reporting the recently acquired information,
while his late aide, wearied with the undertaking,
and covered with Chickahominy mud, had
fallen to the rear. Gradually it came out that Custer,
and not Custer's superior officer, had performed the
important duty. He was immediately called for, and
to his great embarrassment, for his appearance was far
from presentable, was asked by McClellan to make a
report of the situation himself. At the end of the recital
he was asked by his commander, to his amazement,
how he would like to join his staff. McClellan
had, by a rare power peculiar to him, in that short
interview, won Custer's unfailing loyalty and affection,
and when Custer was asked afterwards how he felt at
the time, his eyes filled with tears, and he said:
"<i>I felt I could have died for him.</i>"</p>
<p>This promotion marked the beginning of his future<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
success. In recalling his career, these simple lines,
written by a poet unknown to me, and with which
Frederick Whittaker, in his admirable life of Custer,
brings his biography to a close, involuntarily suggest
themselves:</p>
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Who early thus upon the field of glory</span><br>
<span class="i1">Like thee doth fall, needs for his fame</span><br>

<p>Before ordering <i>Paul</i> in the morning, I called again
at the home of the Custers. The General's father
seemed greatly interested in my journey, and asked
many questions concerning my plans for crossing the
Plains. I was shown the rich and interesting collection
of relics from the Indian country which Custer
had accumulated, and which adds a picturesqueness to
every corner of the house, and with these, some very
striking photographs of the General taken in every
variety of position and costume. After a pleasant
chat, in the course of which Mr. Custer assured me of
his kind solicitude, he walked back to the hotel with
me to see me off.</p>
<p>While riding out of town, I met Mr. Bulkley, and
was introduced to several gentlemen of his acquaintance,
many of whom were schoolmates of Custer during
his boyhood. Mr. Bulkley, speaking for the
Monument Association, assured me that everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
would be done that could further my wishes in Michigan.</p>
<p>The lecture last evening was well attended and
proved a financial success. It was therefore gratifying
to give the entire proceeds to the treasurer, Judge T.
E. Wing, although he generously offered to divide.
Parting with Mr. Bulkley, I continued on my route,
my mind filled with the events of the three preceding
days. Just beyond the town I halted to look
back, and then, determined to prevent any sombre
thoughts, which might follow, put spurs to <i>Paul</i>, who
very soon covered the thirteen miles between Monroe
and this place. As we neared the village, I caught
sight of Huron River, the <i>Wrockumiteogoe</i> of the
Indians, meaning, "clear water." On its banks are
found those mysterious legacies of the Mound Builders—whether
dwellings or tombs, remains for the antiquarian
to determine.</p>

<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Ecorse, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>July Twenty-ninth</i>.</div>
<p>Moved from Rockwood at ten A. M., halting for a
few minutes at Trenton, a small village seven miles
north of Rockwood; and from there, riding on to Wyandotte,
which I reached about one o'clock, and stopped
only a moment at the Biddle House, finding that
dinner was awaiting me at a private residence. I was
ready to answer the hospitable summons promptly.
Between two and five o'clock, I occupied part of
the time in looking about the village, which is chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
noted for its iron industries. Farm implements, iron
ships, iron rails, and in fact everything that can be
made out of iron, is produced here. After dinner I
rode on to Ecorse, which is three miles beyond,
and there found letters and papers telling me that I
was expected at the Russell House, Detroit, on the
evening of the coming Monday. Once within my
hotel, I found the heat almost unbearable, but following
a certain method which I had found by experience
to be a successful one, I was enabled in a measure to
improve my surroundings. To those who might
think my <i>modus operandi</i> somewhat unbecoming, I
would only suggest that they try my mode of travel
through the same region of country, and at the same
season of the year. Personal experience might change
their opinion.</p>
<p>Having been shown to my apartment by the landlord
or one of his assistants, I quietly entered and secured
the door, betraying no surprise upon seeing the
inevitable "feather bed." Taking off my coat, I began
by removing the layers of mattresses, which
had in them a wonderful reserve force of July heat.
I then took my lamp and held it so that its lambent
flame could warm the cockles of every mosquito's
heart clinging to the ceiling. The mosquitoes, quite
averse to the intense heat, quietly dropped into the
little purgatory which I had prepared for them, and
troubled me no more.</p>
<p>So did I secure my repose at the Farmers' Hotel,
and in the morning was in the humor to give the good-natured
proprietor, Louis Cicotte—a typical French
Canadian—a very hearty greeting, and an assurance
of my refreshment.</p>

<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Ecorse, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>July Thirtieth</i>.     </div>
<p>The weather was oppressively warm again on this
day, and business in Ecorse was apparently not "booming."
I found the place quite in keeping with the
majority of French villages along the Detroit River—unambitious
and lifeless.</p>
<p>Two acknowledgments came from Monroe soon
after I left, referring to the aid which I had the
pleasure of giving to those interested in the Custer
Monument. One was a brief and courteous bearer of
thanks, and is as follows:</p>

<p>Our second day at Ecorse ended pleasantly. In the
afternoon my brother and I went for a row on the
river, and in the evening took a walk into the country.
We did not meet with any game, although natural
history proclaims this section the haunt of many
varieties of bird and beast. The first settlers even remember
having a casual acquaintance with the deer,
bear, wolf, wild cat, and a variety of smaller game,
including that interesting little quadruped, the wolverine,
whose name has become the nickname of Michigan.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>FOUR DAYS AT DETROIT.</h3>
<p>After a much-needed rest of a day and
two nights at Ecorse, I left that quiet retreat
on the afternoon of July thirty-first,
with Detroit as my evening objective.
At Fort Wayne, I was met by
Babcock, who brought me the sad intelligence
of the death of my little Detroit
friend, Kitty Murphy, who had failed very
rapidly after her brief visit to Toledo.
We rode forward together, reaching the Russell House
at five o'clock, and there I was met by General
William A. Throop and others, who were appointed
as a committee to receive me. In the evening I lectured
at St. Andrew's Hall, being introduced by
General L. S. Trowbridge and was accompanied on the
platform by several Grand Army comrades.</p>
<p>Immediately after the lecture, I hurried to the
home of my bereaved friends, where I found the
mother and sisters of the dead girl completely prostrated
with grief. The one who had gone was their
favorite, for whom they had the highest hopes, and it
was hard to be reconciled to the passing away of a
life so full of promise and noble purposes. I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
proud to know that one universally loved and
admired had thought of me in her last moments
and had left a token of her friendship.</p>
<p>On the morning of August first, I arranged my affairs
so as to be able to attend the funeral services of
my young friend the following day.</p>
<p>The proceeds of my lecture were handed to the
Monument Fund committee with a letter from me
to be forwarded to Monroe, and its representatives
here acknowledged this in the following note:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<div class="signature"><i>City Hall</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Detroit, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>August 1, 1876</i>.</div>
<p>Received of Captain Willard Glazier, forty dollars, for the benefit
of the Custer Monument Association, as the proceeds of his lecture,
at Detroit, on the evening of July 31, 1876, in aid of such association.</p>
<div class="signature1">[<i>Signed</i>] <span class="smcap">L. S. Trowbridge</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><span class="smcap">William A. Throop</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>Committee</i>.</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>On the afternoon of August second, I went to Kitty's
grave with her family and friends, where we arranged
on the little mound our gifts of flowers. I placed
my own offering—a crown—at her head. It was
the last tribute, the "farewell" which we hoped might
one day be lost in "welcome."</p>
<p>During my stay here, many friends extended invitations
to visit them, but I was able to accept very few.
Among those whom I met was my old comrade,
Captain Charles G. Hampton, who was at the Russell
House to greet me when I arrived. No one could have
been more welcome. Captain Hampton and I began
our somewhat peculiar acquaintance as classmates in
the State Normal College at Albany, New York, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
spring of 1861, where we joined a military organization
known later as the "Normal Company" of the
"Ellsworth Avengers"—Forty-fourth New York Infantry—whose
members were put through a course of
drills in anticipation of future necessity, our voluntary
drill masters being Professors Rodney G. Kimball and
Albert N. Husted.</p>
<p>It was argued by the principal and by the faculty
generally, that while young men were learning how to
teach the schools of the State, it would be well also for
them to be prepared to defend the flag of the State.
We had just closed our term when President Lincoln
issued his call for seventy-five thousand volunteers, and
as it was not at this time the apparent intent of the
Normal Company to enter the service as a body, we decided
to enlist in some other organization.</p>
<p>Hampton went to Rochester where he joined the
Eighth New York Cavalry, while I enlisted in the
Second New York-Harris Light Cavalry, at Troy. We
did not meet again until November, 1863—when, by
the fortune of war, we both became inmates of Libby
Prison. The circumstances that brought us there were,
on his side, wounds and capture in an action with guerrillas
under Mosby; on mine, capture in a cavalry
battle near New Baltimore, Virginia, during Lee's
retreat from the field of Gettysburg.</p>
<p>During our imprisonment at Richmond, Danville,
Macon, Savannah, and Charleston, Captain Hampton
and I belonged to separate messes, so that, while we
met daily, we had very little intimate intercourse. At
Columbia, however, it was different. We arrived there
in the midst of a violent thunder-storm, and were
marched to our "quarters," in an open yard where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the water was running in streams. Hampton had
managed to get possession of a board about twelve feet
long when he met me, and immediately asked if I had
anything to stand or lie on. Upon receiving a negative
answer he said: "Come on, let us share this plank
together." From this time we were messmates, being
joined later by Lieutenant Arthur Richardson of Albany.
When I escaped from Columbia I intrusted to
Captain Hampton a small box in which I had kept
some manuscripts and sketches, that I intended to use
in future work. This he managed to keep until his exchange,
when he expressed it to my home in Northern
New York. We did not meet again until after the close
of the war. The possession of the contents of this box
was of inestimable value to me in getting out my first
book, "Capture, Prison-Pen and Escape." Being
embarrassed for funds before the first edition of it was
published, I wrote to Captain Hampton, and by the
next mail received a generous sum sufficient to carry
me through that critical period. Since then he has
been a most loyal friend and comrade, and during my
stay here, did much to make enjoyable my visit to
the city which he had chosen for his home.</p>
<p>One needs no friends though, to make Detroit attractive,
for its past history and present beauty give it
an unfailing interest. As to the latter, it can never
be justly drawn, however vivid the description, nor
truly understood, however careful the reader. It must
be <i>seen</i>. As to its history, that is general and belongs
to the country, and I know of no great American city
which has a more romantic past.</p>
<p>In the days of the early explorers the present site
was looked upon as favorable for a settlement, commanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
as it does a rich tract of country and lying at
the very entrance to the Upper Lakes. The Iroquois
were then in possession and their village was known
as Teusha Grondi. Both the English and French
coveted this point, but the latter were more enterprising,
and anticipated their rivals by making an appointment
with the Iroquois for a great council at
Montreal, in which the Governor-General of Canada
and others were to have a voice. The wary Frenchmen
presented their claims very plausibly, but failed to win
the approbation of the equally wary Indians. They
were told that their brothers, the Englishmen, had
been refused, and that it was not well to show partiality;
but this excuse had very little weight with the
subjects of the Grande Monarque, who had been accustomed
to make themselves at home generally. The
Governor-General in an impressive speech replied that
neither the Iroquois nor the English had any right to
the land which belonged to the King of France, and
that an expedition had been already sent out to establish
a fort on the Detroit River!</p>
<p>This was indeed the case. La Motte Cadillac, with
a Jesuit missionary and one hundred men, was on his
way, while his countrymen, with the consistency which
has ever marked the dealings between the red and
white races, were asking permission of the Indians.
The French fleet, composed of twenty-five birch canoes
bearing the colors of France, reached the Detroit
River in July, 1701. There was a telling significance
in the floating of that flag over the boats decorated
with Indian symbols and, if the savages had discerned
it, the French commander and his followers would
never have reached their destination. As it was, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
came quietly as friends, and were allowed to establish
themselves without interference.</p>
<p>On the first rise of ground overlooking the river,
the palisades were raised and the guns set, and by the
close of August, Fort Ponchartrain became a reality.
The Miamis and Pottawattomies were soon induced to
make a settlement near by, and afterwards a few Huron
and Ottawa bands collected on the opposite shore of
the river near the site of Windsor. The point quickly
attracted the fur trader, being in a direct line from
Michilimackinac to Montreal and Quebec. For sixty-two
years the French held possession of Detroit, profiting
by her superior location, and the friendship of
the Indians, but their day ended when the sharp eyes
of Wolfe discovered the steep ascent to the "Plains of
Abraham," in Canada, and pointed a way for British
supremacy.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Paris, which was the outcome of the
French and Indian War, called for the surrender of
all the forts held by the French, but news travelled
so slowly that when Captain Rodgers with his two
hundred rangers came to take possession of Fort
Ponchartrain, he found still floating over it the flag of
France. While on his way to execute this mission,
he was met by Pontiac, the Ottawa chief, who was
angered by the transfer of claimants to his land, and
who demanded of Rodgers "what right he had in
entering the dominion of the great Indian King without
permission." The answer he received was far
from satisfactory, but he bided his time to make his
dissatisfaction felt. The same feeling was manifested
everywhere by the Indian allies of the French,
but their wrath was concentrated upon Detroit, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
account of its being the great stronghold of the
West.</p>
<p>In 1763, Pontiac had arranged his famous scheme
for either annihilating the obnoxious new-comers or
driving them east of the Alleghenies. They did not
treat him so considerately as the old claimants, and he
was far-seeing enough to realize the result. Aflame
with hatred and determined to save his people from
the fate that awaited them, he visited the great tribes
that were friendly, and sought their co-operation.
In a speech at the great council held at Ecorse on the
twenty-seventh of April, 1762, he said, "As for these
English—these dogs dressed in red who have come
to rob you of your hunting-grounds and to drive away
the game—you must lift the hatchet against them and
wipe them from the face of the earth." The plan
was worthy of a Napoleon. The confederated tribes
were to attack simultaneously all the Western forts,
while his particular band was to be brought against
Detroit. This point he had expected to take by
stratagem and would no doubt have succeeded but
for the betrayal of the plot by an Ojibway maiden
who was in love with the British commandant. The
day before its execution this Indian girl brought Major
Gladwyn a pair of moccasins which he had asked her
to make for him, and on her way home with the remainder
of the deer-skin, which he had furnished
for the same purpose, she lingered about the gate
so as to attract the attention of the sentinel. He
saw that she seemed to be troubled about something,
and asked her to return. Wavering between love and
duty to her race, she hesitated; but finally the impulse
of her heart prevailed, and returning to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
room of the commandant, she told him the terrible
secret.</p>
<p>Pontiac was to come to the fort on the morrow
ostensibly to hold peaceful negotiations with his white
brothers, but really to massacre them. His warriors,
who had cunningly shortened their rifles by sawing off
a part of the barrels, so that they might carry them
concealed beneath their blankets, were to fall upon
Gladwyn and his men at a given signal. This news
was lightly received although the statements of the
Indian girl seemed to be verified by a slight thread of
evidence which had from time to time been brought
to Gladwyn's notice. He laughed at the thought of
danger at such a time, when the peace which had
lasted for two years appeared so likely to continue; but
while he doubted Pontiac's real intentions, he decided
to be prepared for any issue. The guards were
doubled, sentinels were stationed on the ramparts, and
when the great chief came in the guise of friendship,
he was completely nonplussed by the show of discipline
in the garrison. Entering the north gate with his
sixty blanketed conspirators, he found himself confronted
by a double line of red-coated soldiers, their
muskets held at "present arms." At the corners of
the streets were groups of fur traders, and at regular
intervals the silence was broken by the beating of
drums.</p>
<p>Surprised at every turn, and fearing that his plot
had been discovered, Pontiac walked on sullenly endeavoring
to conceal his annoyance. When he reached
the council-house he said to Gladwyn, "Why do I
see so many of my father's young men standing in the
streets with their guns?" The commandant lightly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
replied that he had just been drilling them to preserve
discipline and that it was moreover a custom with the
English to thus honor their guests. These suavely
spoken words failed to reassure the chief, who sat
down for a few moments without speaking; but having
recovered his self-possession and assuming with it
an habitual expression of stoical defiance, he arose and
began his harangue. Gladwyn, he noticed, instead of
listening to what was being said, kept his eyes steadfastly
upon the movements of the other Indians, and
when the belt of wampum was taken up and the chief
began to reverse it in his hands—the signal for attack—Gladwyn
made a quick motion and in an instant the
dusky semi-circle was startled by the grounding of
arms and the beating of drums.</p>
<p>Thus interrupted and foiled, Pontiac took his seat
in silence. Gladwyn then arose, and began his speech
as though nothing unusual had occurred; but after a
few moments he changed his tone, accused Pontiac of
treachery, and stepping quickly to the nearest Indian
threw open his blanket and disclosed the hidden
weapon. He then told Pontiac to leave the fort at
once, assuring him that he would be allowed to go in
safety. The unfortunate result of this act of clemency
was very soon felt, for as soon as the Indians were
outside of the gates, they turned and fired upon the
garrison, thus beginning the terrible siege which was
to last fifteen months.</p>
<p>Autumn approached, and, as the crops were poor,
several of the tribes withdrew for the winter, but
Pontiac, untiring in his efforts to harass his enemies,
remained, sending messages in the meantime to several
of the French posts, asking their help. In November<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
he received word from the commandant of Fort
Chartres on the Mississippi telling him that it was
impossible for the French to give any help as they
had signed a treaty with the English; and later
similar messages reached him from other points. Still
he did not give up. His allies had captured eight
forts, and if he could take Detroit success would undoubtedly
follow.</p>
<p>In the spring the tribes returned to renew the attack
upon the wellnigh exhausted garrison, keeping
up their fiendish tortures, capturing vessels sent with
supplies and reinforcements, and bringing the handful
of brave men within the palisades to the verge of despair.
As summer advanced the anxious watchers,
hearing the sunset gun thunder out across the water,
thought that each night might be their last; but off
in the East, General Bradstreet and his large force
were starting to the rescue, and by midsummer they
had crushed the hopes, if not the proud spirit of Pontiac.
Sending one of his officers to this chief with
terms of peace, his advances were received with the
coldest disdain. Captain Morris, who was the ambassador,
was met beyond the Indian camp by Pontiac
himself, but the chief refused to extend his hand, and
bending his glittering eyes upon the officer said, with
a voice full of bitterness and hatred, "The English
are liars!"</p>
<p>All attempts at conciliation were made in vain.
Pontiac, taking with him four hundred warriors, went
away, revisiting all the tribes, sending the wampum
belt and hatchet stained with vermilion far and wide,
and exhorting the Indians to unite in the common
cause, threatening, if they refused, to consume them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
"as the fire consumes the dry grass of the prairie."
He failed to rouse them, however, and was forced at
last to return to Detroit and accept peace.</p>
<p>The feelings that surged in his savage heart, when
he found himself thus defeated, can only be guessed.
Chagrined and disappointed, he retired to Illinois,
and there perished by the hand of an assassin. No
stone marks his burial-place, "and the race whom he
hated with such burning rancor trample with unceasing
footsteps over his forgotten grave."</p>
<p>The early history of Detroit is full of tragedy, and
although the beautiful river and its islands, the splendid
forests and sunny fields that encompass it, seem to
have been intended for peace and the play of romance,
they were instead the scenes of treachery and carnage.
During the war of the Revolution, Detroit and Mackinaw,
far from the field of action, nevertheless had
their share in it. From their magazines Indians were
furnished with arms and ammunition and were sent
out with these to harass and destroy the frontier settlements
of New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and
Kentucky, receiving a price upon their return for the
scalps which they brought! Besides these Indian expeditions,
the local militia went out, at one time under
Captain Byrd, and again under Henry Hamilton.
The latter, in an attempt to protect the British interests
on the Wabash, was cleverly captured at Vincennes
by General George Clarke, who advanced upon this
post with his men supported by a formidable but
harmless device in the form of a cannon cut out of a
tree. Hamilton, dreading the artillery, surrendered,
and the people of Detroit, believing that the victor
would march against them, erected a new fort near the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
present corner of Fort and Shelby streets, which they
named Lenault. During the war of 1812, this name
was changed and the post became known as Fort
Shelby.</p>
<p>After the treaty of 1783 the western posts did not
at once acknowledge American jurisdiction, and among
these Detroit seemed to be the most defiant, but when
Wayne effectually weakened the strength of the
Indians, there was a general surrender, although the
United States forces did not take actual possession until
July eleventh, 1796. With childish spite, the British,
upon leaving this fort, broke the windows of the
barracks, filled the wells with stones and did all they
could to annoy those who were to succeed them, and
when General Hull came there as governor of the
territory, it is possible that the ruin which he found
was occasioned by the same spirit of revenge.</p>
<p>During the succeeding years, Detroit was again one
of the points towards which an unpropitious fate
pointed a finger. The Indians, still believing that the
Americans were driving them from their land, were
making preparations to attack the settlements, led on
by the powerful influence of the two chiefs, Tecumseh
and the Prophet.</p>
<p>At a grand council the assembled tribes were told,
according to the policy of these chiefs, that the Great
Spirit had appeared to chief Tront and had told him
that He was the father of the English, French,
Spaniards and Indians, but that the Americans were
the sons of the Evil One! Under such influence the
uprising which resulted in the war between Great
Britain and the United States began.</p>
<p>When General Brock, seconded by Tecumseh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
marched on Detroit, he requested of the Chief, in case
the place was taken, that the inhabitants should be
spared massacre, to which the haughty savage replied,
"that he despised them too much to have anything to
do with them." The result of this attack, and the inexplicable
conduct of General Hull, had aroused a
strong feeling of disgust, and universal sympathy was
felt for those brave men, who, upon hearing that their
superior officer was surrendering without an attempt at
resistance, "dashed their muskets upon the ground in
an agony of mingled shame and indignation."</p>
<p>Victories elsewhere finally obliged the British to
evacuate, and on the eighteenth of October, General
Harrison and Commodore Perry issued a proclamation
from this fort, which once more assured the people
of Michigan of protection.</p>
<p>Passing through the test of fire and sword, Detroit
has gradually progressed in all those ways which go
to make up a great and prosperous city. Fulfilling
her natural destiny she has become one of the most
important commercial centres in the United States,
and as a port of entry can boast with reason of her
strength. The narrow lanes which were enclosed
within the pickets of Fort Ponchartrain, and trodden
by men in the French uniform, in English red coats
and in the skins of the deer and beaver, have reached
out over many miles, and have become an intricate
maze of streets and avenues, lined with homes and
business houses which bear no trace of the old time
block house and trader's cabin.</p>
<p>Here and there, where history is preserved, one finds
a few relics of the "dead past" embalmed in paint or
print or labelled within the glass case of a museum;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
but the present Detroit is interesting enough without
these. In every direction it is brightened by parks and
adorned by fountains; and the broad avenues lined by
generous borders of grass and shaded by cool lines of
trees, are something for Americans to be proud of,
especially when they recall the fact that "Johnny Crapeau"
once asserted that this particular corner of the
new world belonged to the Grande Monarque; and
"John Bull" in turn claimed it for his own.</p>
<p>One of the prettiest parts of the city, and perhaps
within the possibility of description, is the Campus
Martius. On it stands the suggestive if somewhat
unusual monument designed by Randolph Rogers
and erected by the city at a cost of sixty thousand
dollars. The surmounting figure is that of an
Indian maiden representing the State, and on the
tablet beneath, the inscription tells us that it was
placed there "in honor of the martyrs who fell and the
heroes who fought in defence of Liberty and Union."
Everywhere are evidences of a high appreciation of
beauty and comfort, and if the people of Detroit are
sometimes tempted to seek a change and rest on some
of the little island resorts of the river, or on Lake St.
Clair, it is not because their own homes are unattractive.
Some one has said, "if places could speak, they
would describe people far better than people can
describe places," and this is especially true of this great
city. It is impossible by words to do it justice. The
public buildings, the thronged streets, the busy harbor,
the shady avenues, must be seen to be appreciated,
and there are very few places which will justify praise
and repay expectation more liberally than this splendid
City of the Strait.</p>

<h3>DETROIT TO CHICAGO.</h3>
<h4>Eighty-fifth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Inkster House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Inkster, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>August 4, 1876.</i></div>
<p>Having before me a lecture appointment
at Ypsilanti, which, considering the object
I had in view through Michigan, I felt
must be met, I rode out of Detroit at
three o'clock in the afternoon, somewhat
reluctantly perhaps, but within a very short
time the love of travel was again upon
me, and I found myself easily reconciled.
<i>Paul</i> being in the most delightful spirits,
after four days of unbroken rest, displayed quite a
little animation as I mounted him in front of the
residence of friends on Cass Avenue, and when we
had reached the open country, I gave him the rein and
allowed him to trot or gallop, as he felt inclined.
The edge of his impatience having worn off, he resumed
his habitual easy canter which made the saddle
so enjoyable, and at this pace we covered fourteen miles,
reaching our destination a few minutes after six o'clock.
There was an agreeable if not decided contrast between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the last stopping-place and the present one. A
hundred towers announced the approach to a great
city, as we neared Detroit; but here a solitary spire rose
against the sky, and while the Detroit River teems,
throughout its entire length with water-craft of all
sorts, the almost unknown little river that winds along
between Detroit and Inkster, is at this point as quiet
as one of the untravelled streams of the North. The
Michigan Central Railway follows its shore for many
miles, and as I kept to the highway in the same direction,
I could see it shining occasionally through an
opening in the trees. The waters of this river are no
doubt full of fish, as are all the streams of Michigan,
and they have besides a fine characteristic—a sparkling
clearness.</p>

<div class="signature1"><i>August Fifth</i>.   </div>
<p>A forbidding sky hung over Inkster as I took my
seat in the saddle at ten o'clock, but "Forward" was
the watchword, and there was moreover a charm in
variety, for sunny skies had become rather monotonous
and, under the circumstances, uncomfortable. The
dust was well laid when we had gone only a short
distance, but it rose again in a new form as <i>Paul</i>
quickened his pace, so that we did not present a very
dashing appearance to the Ypsilantians, after sixteen
miles of such travel.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption37">

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption37">A SUMMER AFTERNOON.</span>
</div>
<p>Several times I was obliged to turn from the road,
once taking shelter under a tree and again in a woodshed.
There were in town, however, those who could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
excuse the appearance of a bespattered traveller—brave
men who had gone from Ypsilanti in the early days
of the Rebellion, and who had learned from long campaigning
to look upon their comrades without criticism.
The brave Fourteenth Infantry started out
from here under Colonel Robert Sinclair, and joining
Sherman in Georgia took a lively part in all the movements
of his army, until the fall of Atlanta; numbering
among their proudest achievements the repulse of
the enemy at Bentonville, North Carolina, where the
hurriedly constructed works of the Federals were
charged and taken and then regained at the point of
the bayonet; and their part in the battle of Jonesboro,
Georgia, in 1864, which was the last of Sherman's
brilliant operations around Atlanta. Many of these
brave fellows perished on the field of battle, but
enough remain to keep fresh the memory of those
stirring days and to add the influence of their patriotism
to the young Ypsilanti.</p>
<h4>Eighty-seventh Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Hawkins House</i>,     </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Ypsilanti, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>August Sixth</i>.   </div>
<p>On the previous evening I met a large number of
men of the town, who gave me a hearty welcome, and
as many of them were old soldiers, they expressed
their satisfaction with the purpose of my lecture,
favoring me with considerable enthusiasm in Union
Hall.</p>
<p>The patriots of Michigan have many proud deeds to
tell of, and are distinguished for their gallant service.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Their military leaders were invariably zealous, and
their civil leaders unceasing in their encouragement.
"We cannot consent to have one star obliterated from
our flag" was the sentiment, and with the saving of
the Union at heart, the men went into battle.</p>
<p>During Wheeler's repulse at Strawberry Plains in
August, 1864, eight Michigan men were left to guard
McMillan's Ford on the Halston. One of these,
knowing the danger of his position, deserted, leaving
his seven companions to "hold the fort." This handful
kept back a brigade under the Confederate general
almost four hours, but the Rebels crossed above and
below the ford and captured the guard. One of their
number, a farrier, was wounded, and Wheeler coming
up to him began a conversation. Finally Wheeler
said, "Are all the Tenth Michigan like you fellows?"
"Oh, no," said the other, "we are mostly horse farriers
and blacksmiths and not much accustomed to fighting."
"Well," said Wheeler, "if I had three hundred such
men as you, I could march straight through h—l!"</p>
<h4>Eighty-eighth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>McKune House</i>,   <br>
<span class="smcap">Chelsea, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>August Seventh</i>.   </div>
<p>Left Ypsilanti bright and early in order to save
time, for although nearly the middle of August, I still
felt the intense heat, and the dry dusty roads often
made my daily journeys far from agreeable. For
several days the mercury ranged between 85° and 90°,
and as the route was at this time due west, the sun
nearly stared me out of countenance in the afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Ann Arbor was reached about ten o'clock, but I did
not take more than a passing glance at the University,
noticing, however, that women as well as men were
among the students—a recent and wise change in the
law of the institution. The people were raising a
flag over one of the buildings as I rode through, and
on it in conspicuous letters were the names of Tilden
and Hendricks.</p>
<p>Delhi, with no signs of a Lalla Rookh, and Scio,
modest under the dignity of its suggestive Latin name,
were quaint landmarks along my way, but I rode on
a mile beyond to have dinner at Dexter. The Huron
River has its source near here, in one of a cluster of
lakelets, bordering on Livingstone and Washtenaw
counties. All Michigan is covered with these small
bodies of water, which, with the streams, lie upon its
green surface like pearls in a network of silver.</p>
<p>Leaving Dexter, I had company all the way to
Chelsea. Large flocks of sparrows flew along, lighting
upon the telegraph wires, and as I approached they
would fly away and settle again farther along, keeping
up a kind of race, which was evidently fun for them,
and which greatly amused me. It seemed as though
they were tireless, and when I and my horse reached
our destination fatigued, after twenty-six miles of
travel in the sun, these strong-winged fellows were
ready for another flight. I do not doubt that they
easily accomplished the return journey, for we cannot
compute the distance they can cover in a day. They
are hardy little fellows and, despite the objections urged
against them, have many admirable qualities, not the
least among which is their tenacity of purpose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>
<h4>Eighty-ninth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Hurd House</i>,      <br>
<span class="smcap">Jackson, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>August Eighth</i>.   </div>
<p>A few minutes after seven in the morning found me
in the saddle at Chelsea. I stopped on my way at the
<i>Herald</i> office and then struck off towards the main
road, along which I cantered to Grass Lake, where I
had dinner and remained until three o'clock. This
rest was thoroughly enjoyed, the more so perhaps, as I
learned before leaving Chelsea that if my advance
agents had not made arrangements for me elsewhere,
the people would have asked me to lecture here. In
that event I should not have been so familiar with
the quiet charms of Grass Lake.</p>
<p>Probably there are those who, if they had been in
my place, would have denied themselves these halts
along the way, but they would have been deprived of
a double gratification. In the first place they would
miss much of the character of the country through
which they passed, the real difference in the manners
and customs of the people; and they would miss the
opportunity of assuring the credulous that they were
not making a test ride across the continent within a
certain time and for a certain reward.</p>
<p>News often travels incredibly fast when there are no
evident means of communication, and I was often
amused by the curiosity which my advent excited
and the reasons which were whispered about in the
villages through which I passed, as to the object of
my journey. Indeed many Michiganders, from quiet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
haunts in their native wilds, made short pilgrimages
"to town" in order to look at one whom they fancied
might hold a proud place for having crossed the
continent in so many days, hours and seconds. My
horse even was looked upon with awe, as "the charger
upon which General Washington rode during the war
of the Revolution!" But this anachronism belongs
to New York.</p>
<p>Leaving Grass Lake late in the afternoon, it was
necessary to make better time in order to cover the
remainder of the twenty three miles lying between
Chelsea and Jackson. The pace quickened. I came
into the latter city at six o'clock, and rode directly to
the hotel.</p>
<h4>Ninetieth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Hurd House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Jackson, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>August Ninth</i>.</div>
<p>I clipped the following notice from the <i>Citizen</i> of
this date, as a memento of my stay at Jackson. It
chronicled the fact that:</p>
<blockquote><div><p>"Captain Willard Glazier lectured last evening in the interest of
the Custer Monument Fund. His lecture was a good historical
review delivered with graceful rhetoric and at times real eloquence.
The Captain is still in the city giving his horse a rest; a noble
Kentucky Black Hawk, whom he has ridden all the way from
Boston, and whom he expects to carry him to San Francisco. He
starts to-morrow morning for Battle Creek, where he lectures on
Saturday evening."</p></div></blockquote>
<p>My advance agent, Babcock, went on to Battle Creek
in the morning, where arrangements were made with
local committees for my lecture on the twelfth. After
he had gone I made a leisurely inspection of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
city. It was impossible to do more on account of the
extreme heat.</p>
<p>This may no doubt be considered the centre of the
closely populated southern end of Michigan, a region
dear, in times past, to the heart of the Indian, but
which knows him no more. A Chippewa chief standing
upon this soil, once said: "These lakes, these
woods, these mountains were left to us by our ancestors;
they are our inheritance, and we will part with them
to no one." He knew not the strength of the pale
faces who listened; for within a few years they were
ready to claim, on the same grounds, those hills, and
lakes, and mountains for their own.</p>
<p>Compared to the peninsula, whose mineral-laden
shores are washed by Superior, Michigan and Huron,
there is the greatest contrast; and La Hontan, making
a little exploratory trip up there before anyone else,
called it "the fag end of the world." These words
might still be applied to some of the wildest northern
points, but here is the very heart of civilization.</p>
<p>Jackson lies in the coal fields that reach down
through several of the southern counties. This deposit
is not rich, owing to the amount of sulphur in it, and
the demand is chiefly local. The Grand River divides
the town and, with the bridge that spans it, adds much
to the picturesque effect.</p>
<h4>Ninety-first Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Cooley House</i>,    </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Parma, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>August Tenth</i>.    </div>
<p>Spent the forenoon in my room at the Hurd House,
Jackson, writing letters to my wife, Major Hastings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
and others. In the afternoon there was a street parade
of Howe's London Circus which was a very fantastic
affair, but which seemed to be hugely enjoyed by
everybody. Later in the day the great tent was upset
by a gust of wind, accompanied by a thunder-shower,
and a droll scene followed, which caused considerable
excitement. The people were left exposed with the
rain coming down upon them in torrents. So far I
have seen nothing more amusing than the country boys
and girls rushing up town drenched, and for once at
least indifferent to the charms of the "big show."</p>
<p>The storm having passed, I ordered <i>Paul</i> after
supper, rode down to the office of the <i>Patriot and
Citizen</i>, and after a few minutes' conversation with
the editor, hurried on toward Parma, which was
reached late in the evening. The ride in the dark
was cool, but somewhat lonely.</p>
<p>It was probably on such nights as this that young
Dean, the enterprising settler of years ago, played his
nocturnal tricks upon his neighbors. He came out to
Michigan when it was a wilderness, to make his
fortune by clearing land at ten dollars an acre, and
while he was drudging he expected to have a little fun.
It was his habit to work away all day chopping trees
within an inch of the falling point, and then about ten
o'clock, when the settlers were well asleep, to go out
and give a blow to the end tree, so that it would fall
against the others and send them crashing like a row
of ninepins. How the old forests must have rung
with their thundering and how that plotter Dean must
have relished his mischief!</p>
<p>As I approached Parma, in the darkness I could see
nothing about the village to suggest that other Parma,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
far away under an Italian sky, but there is a resemblance,
for the European duchy and its modest
American namesake both lie in a rich agricultural
region; and if I mistake not the dull white freestone
that is quarried here in such large quantities, finds a
prototype over the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a></span></p>

<h4>Ninety-second Day.</h4>

<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Marshall, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>August Eleventh</i>.     </div>
<p>As there was a heavy rainfall in the morning, I
waited in Parma until nearly ten o'clock, and even
then was obliged to start in a thunder-shower in
order to keep my appointment for the following
evening at Battle Creek. This required no sacrifice,
for, excepting the discomfort of wet clothes, the change
was agreeable. I reached Albion in time for dinner,
and immediately made myself comfortable at the hotel.
Rest and refreshment having the desired effect, I afterward
took a short stroll through the town, which I
found very wide awake, although the Methodist
college, the life of the place, was still closed for the
summer vacation. In the meantime the men of the
village had met, and before I remounted, came to me
and persuaded me to return by rail and deliver the
Ouster lecture on the fifteenth. Glad to do all I
could for the "Benefit Fund," I readily consented and
started away with the good wishes of the impromptu
committee. Marshall, being only twelve miles beyond,
was reached early in the evening, so that before dark I
had time to get a mental picture of the place. Calhoun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
County has its capitol here, and in 1853 it was looked
upon as one of the most flourishing towns in Michigan.
It has not reached the predicted pinnacle of importance,
but it has a pleasant situation, some flourishing flour
mills, and is altogether a credit to the "Wolverines."</p>
<h4>Ninety-third Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Potter House</i>,      </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Battle Creek, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>August Twelfth</i>.      </div>
<p>As soon as <i>Paul</i> was led out in front of the Witt
House at Marshall, a large crowd gathered about us;
and when I had taken my seat in the saddle, one of
the number stepped forward in behalf of the townspeople
to invite me to return at a time which had
previously been agreed upon and lecture on the heroes
of the Revolution. Giving them the best promise I
could, I hurried away as I had a good six hours' ride
before me.</p>
<p>Since the day before there had been a decided change
in the weather. The sun blazed down with almost
tropical heat, drying up the roads and making my way
a veritable fiery furnace. I had a rare opportunity
for watching "Old Sol" on these solitary rides, as he appeared
unfailingly in the morning, swung through the
heavens, and vanished in the west at night. It was
now harvest time, and since that early day in May on
which I started westward, I had kept my eye on him
like a true worshipper, half understanding the pagan
with his devotion to Apollo, and half in sympathy
with the Indian who greets the Sun-god and weaves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the splendid symbol into pouch and canoe and mocassin.
Between the hours of ten and four particularly
the heat was intense, but in other respects the day was
uneventful.</p>
<h4>Ninety-fourth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Private House</i>,   </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Battle Creek, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>August Thirteenth</i>.</div>
<p>On the preceding evening a full house greeted me
at Stuart's Hall, where I was introduced by a comrade
of the G. A. R., Lieutenant Eugene T. Freeman.
After the lecture I met several of the leading men of
the town and later was invited to a private residence,
where I was made at home during the remainder of
my stay. The Lieutenant called for me on Sunday
morning, and I accompanied him to church, meeting
the pastor, Rev. L. D. Palmer, who spoke with animation
and warmth and made the service an effective one.
I enjoyed it all the more perhaps as I realized that before
many Sundays I would be on the Great Plains beyond
the Mississippi, where churches are known to be
very rare. Continuing his courtesies, my comrade friend
drove me out to the favorite resort, Lake Goguac, in
the afternoon and there I had several fine views of
the surrounding country. This little incident suggests
an interesting theory concerning one of the pre-historic
races who are supposed to have occupied this section
of the country. It seems that in the ancient symbolic
manuscripts of the Aztecs frequent mention is made of
a land which they called Aztelan, compounded of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
symbols A. T. S. and signifying "Lake Country," from
which also their own name is derived, making it to
mean "the people of the lake country." They refer
to their former home as a country lying towards the
north and giving further details which might be
descriptive of the Peninsular State—so the theorist
thinks. As a coincident, but advanced nevertheless
as a strong argument, the learned gentleman states
that the Wyandots have a tradition to the effect that
hundreds of years ago, the builders of the mounds
were driven southward by invaders from the northeast;
and pursuing the magic thread, he suggests that
the Aztecs were usurpers in Mexico according to their
own traditions and the corroboration of Spanish
history. If this is the case, my comrade and myself,
in visiting this pretty little lake, may have trodden
upon the same soil which had been pressed by the
feet of the mysterious builders of the mounds. I am
personally a trifle sceptical on this point, and believe
that the key to this part of ancient history is yet to be
found.</p>
<h4>Ninety-fifth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Kalamazoo House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Kalamazoo, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>August Fourteenth</i>.</div>
<p>On this day I passed a fine wheat-growing section
in the valley of the Kalamazoo, whose richest part is
probably near the Big Village—its namesake. This
river, which drains Hillsdale, Kalamazoo, Calhoun
and Allegan counties, and is navigable for forty miles
above its mouth, has, I believe, more traffic than any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
one of the rivers of Michigan. Throughout its length
of two hundred miles it flows through pine and oak
forests, through the richest section of a State famed for
its agricultural products, and like the Nile, if I may so
compare the relics of a great people with those of one
comparatively unknown, is looked down upon by the
silent monuments of the past. To me the comparison
is not unreasonable, for I consider the tumuli of those
mound-builders scattered over the hills and valleys of
America, worthy of as much interest and respect
as the more splendid remnants of a higher civilization.</p>
<p>At this point the stream is still broad and picturesque.
As to its name I am undecided. According to some
it is a corruption of Ke-Kenemazoo, meaning "the
boiling pot," and according to others of Kik-alamazoo,
"the mirage river," because to the fanciful Indian the
stones that jutted, dark and wet, out of the river-bed
looked like otters. The village on its banks was settled
in 1829, and after being known for two years by the
name of its first settler, Bronson, became, in 1836,
Kalamazoo. It is thoroughly alive, has a population
of about 18,000, and its position as the half-way place
between Detroit and Chicago adds considerably to its
importance. I lectured here to a full house, being
introduced by Major R. F. Judson, formerly of
General Custer's staff, and bearing a high reputation
as a soldier. Intercourse with one who had known
the General so well, and who held him in such loyal
regard, gave me a new insight into the life of</p>
<div class="poem">
<span class="i4">                  "That mighty man of war,</span><br>
<span class="i0">A lion in battle, and a child by the fireside."</span>

<h4>Ninety-sixth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Albion House</i>,   <br>
<span class="smcap">Albion, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>August Fifteenth</i>.</div>
<p>I came back to this place from Kalamazoo on the
afternoon train and was met at the station by R. A.
Daniels, who went with me to the hotel. The introduction
at the Opera House where I lectured in the
evening was made by Captain Rienzi Loud. When I
concluded, I found that the good old custom of "passing
round the hat" had not yet lost favor, for two
gentlemen, having furnished the "hat," assumed the
role of collectors and the "Fund" was within a very
short time substantially increased. When this ceremony
was over a man in the audience rose and said:
"Captain Glazier! I came in after the hat was passed,
but I want to give something toward the 'Monument;'"
and suiting the action to the word he made his contribution.
The whole ceremony was so suggestive of a
certain little church up in St. Lawrence County, New
York, where the same custom prevails on Sundays,
that I came very near fancying myself the parson, and
if some of my comrades had not come up immediately
and given me a hearty greeting, I might have been
guilty of pronouncing a benediction!</p>
<p>As it was quite late when I reached this point, having
made twenty-five miles since ten o'clock, there
was very little time for sightseeing, but I learned that
here was the seat of Ames College, a thriving Methodist
institution admitting both men and women, and
proudly referred to by the people of Albion.</p>

<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Battle Creek, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>August Sixteenth</i>.</div>
<p>Called at Captain Loud's law office at Albion in the
morning, and had a delightful chat over old times,
our topic an inexhaustible one—the battles and incidents
of the late war. As this town was only a short distance
away, I was tempted to prolong the chat into a
visit, finding the Captain a cordial comrade.</p>
<p>According to previous agreement I lectured in the
evening at Wayne Hall, Marshall, having an introduction
by Colonel Charles W. Dickie.</p>
<p>My horse was now in Michigan City, being treated
for the sore on his back by an old comrade, who since
the war had attained quite a reputation as a veterinary
surgeon. The delay was somewhat annoying as I
anticipated trouble in crossing the Rockies, if I did
not reach them before the season was too far advanced;
but there was a possibility of disabling the animal if
his affliction were neglected, and my sympathies were
with him. As the delay could not be avoided I
availed myself of the "Iron Horse" and on it made
brief tours to the neighboring towns.</p>
<p>At this time it was very easy to agree with the theory
of the fatalist that "whatever is, is right," for by an
accident I was enabled to meet more agreeable people,
to enjoy their hospitality, and to see more, which was
my chief purpose in crossing the continent.</p>
<p>A philosopher never worries about little hindrances,
for he soon learns that a delay often proves to be

<div class="signature"><i>August Seventeenth</i>.   </div>
<p>Soon after breakfast I left Marshall for Battle Creek
on a freight train, as there were no passenger coaches
over the road until the afternoon. This mode of
travel, if not the most luxurious, was at least novel,
and we made very good time. Between the two
places the face of the country hardly changed in appearance.
There were the same fields of wheat and
corn, and at Battle Creek evidently as much business
in the flour mills as at Marshall.</p>
<p>The creek, uniting here with the Kalamazoo, after
a serpentine course of forty miles, supplies the water-power
and gives the necessary impetus to trade.</p>
<p>I have heard that the tributary won its bellicose
name through a little difficulty between the first surveyors
of public land who came to mark this section
and some Indians. The quarrel ended seriously, and,
as the tradition goes, two of the Indians were killed.</p>
<p>It may have been that the latter were making an
attempt to hold the ground, and that it was but one
of the many similar occurrences which were to convince
the red man that he was superfluous. Calhoun
County was certainly worth making a stand for. Its
soil was rich, providing abundantly for the simple
wants of the savage, and in the clear waters of the St.
Joseph and the Kalamazoo tributaries many a paddle
had descended with a deft stroke, upon the gleaming
back of pike and pickerel.</p>

<h4>Ninety-ninth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>32 Portage Street</i></div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Kalamazoo, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>August Eighteenth</i>.      </div>
<p>At nine o'clock I was once more on <i>Paul's</i> back
possessed of a stronger sense of satisfaction than had
been mine for many days. The truth is, I had missed
my four-legged companion sorely. Reached Augusta
at noon. I had a good old-fashioned dinner; and the
horse something that was quite satisfactory, and at
four o'clock we started on again for Kalamazoo. Soon
after I left the village a thunder-shower came up, but
there was a convenient tree at hand and we were not
slow in reaching it. Thinking that all was well I
again put spur to <i>Paul</i> and we started forward, this
time coming in sight of the little village of Comstock,
three miles east of Kalamazoo, before our progress
was interrupted. Off in the distance the warning
whistle of an approaching train broke in upon the
stillness; the familiar rumble of wheels followed,
and in a moment more, as it was rushing by, <i>Paul</i>
made a leap of forty feet over the embankment.
He was good enough to leave me and the saddle behind.
It was a narrow escape and I was severely
stunned, but was soon up again getting my bearings.
I found my horse standing in the stream
stripped of everything except the bridle, and, with the
exception of a slight trace of nervousness in him, looking
as though nothing unusual had occurred. We
reached Kalamazoo a little later, and there I wrote to
Mr. Bulkley as follows:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<div class="signature1"><i>Kalamazoo House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Kalamazoo, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>August 18, 1876</i>.      </div>
<p><span class="smcap">J. M. Bulkley, Esq.</span>,<br>
      <i>Secretary Custer Monument Association,<br>
            Monroe, Michigan</i>.
</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir:</span>—I have the pleasure of transmitting to Judge Wing,
through Major R. F. Judson, the net proceeds of my lecture, delivered
in this place on the evening of the sixteenth instant. I desire
to accompany my gift with an acknowledgment of many
courtesies extended by the press and band of this patriotic village.
I resume my journey this afternoon and shall speak at Niles, South
Bend, and Laporte before the close of the present week. Hoping
that your brightest anticipations for the "Monument" may be most
fully realized, I remain</p>
<div class="signature">Very sincerely yours,             <span class="smcap">Willard Glazier.</span></div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This letter I preserved, as I wished to have all the
correspondence upon the subject of the "Monument" for
future reference.</p>
<h4>One Hundredth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Dyckman House</i>,   <br>
<span class="smcap">Paw Paw, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>August Nineteenth</i>.   </div>
<p>Had an early breakfast at Kalamazoo. Ordered
<i>Paul</i>, and mounting him rode through the Big Village
to take a last look. Before leaving I called upon Major
Judson and Colonel F. W. Curtenius. The latter of
whom has had a brilliant career. Graduating from Hamilton
College in 1823, he studied law and later went to
South America, enlisting in the cause of the Brazilians.
He served through the war with Mexico, was
appointed adjutant-general of Michigan in 1855,
holding this office until 1861, having received the
high title of Senator in 1853 and being re-elected to
the office in 1867. The Colonel's father was a general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
in the war of 1812, and was for many years a member
of the New York Legislature. I am only familiar
with Major Judson's military record, but his services
as a citizen are no doubt as honorable as was his
career as a soldier.</p>
<p>With these gentlemen I entrusted the proceeds of
my lecture and the letter to Mr. Bulkley, with the request
that they be transmitted to the Monument Association
at Monroe. They expressed their appreciation
of my gift in warm terms and handed me the
following acknowledgments:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Kalamazoo, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>August 19, 1876</i>.</div>
<p>Received of Captain Willard Glazier the net proceeds of his
lecture at this place, which sum is to be applied to the fund for the
erection of a Monument to the memory of the late General Custer at
Monroe City, Michigan. We take great pleasure in speaking of
Captain Glazier in the highest terms, not only on account of the self-devotion
he has manifested in a noble cause, but of his indomitable
perseverance and energy. We trust he will, wherever he goes, receive
the unanimous support of the citizens whom he addresses.</p>
<div class="signature1"><span class="smcap">F. W. Curtenius</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>Late Colonel U. S. Volunteers</i>.</div>
<p>I take great pleasure in fully endorsing the above, and recommending
to public confidence and support Captain Willard Glazier,
in his efforts in behalf of the Custer Monument Association,</p>
<div class="signature1"><span class="smcap">R. F. Judson</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>Late Aide to General Custer</i>.</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>With an exchange of salutations and good wishes
from the friends whose courtesies I considered it an
honor to receive, I left Kalamazoo for Paw Paw.
The ride between these towns was unusually trying.
<i>Paul's</i> back was still tender, the heat was intense, and
under these circumstances it was necessary to cover
fourteen miles before any refreshment could be had.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>
<h4>One hundred and first Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Dyckman House</i>,   </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Paw Paw, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>August Twentieth</i>.   </div>
<p>This Sunday was a perfect day for rest, and I indulged
in a generous amount. Had breakfast at
eight o'clock, after which I strolled through the
streets of the Van Buren County capital, finding them
generally like all other village streets, but with enough
individuality about them to make them interesting.
The High School stood, with the usual dignity of educational
institutions, prominent among the neat cottages,
and in the business portion two or three newspaper
offices gave unfailing proof of local alertness.</p>
<p>The east and west branches of the Paw Paw River
meet here and hurry on to pay their tribute to the
Kalamazoo, offering their united strength to the business
concerns which man has erected on their shores.
The outlying farms thus naturally irrigated are very
rich, and give, with the extensive lumbering interests,
a very flourishing and prosperous appearance to this
section of country and a certain briskness to the trade
at Paw Paw.</p>
<p>On returning to my room I copied the testimonials
given me by Colonel Curtenius and Major Judson of
Kalamazoo, wrote several letters, attended to some
neglected dates in my journal, and made my plans for
the next few days. It was my intention to go to
South Bend by rail the following morning, to lecture
there in the evening and then proceed to Grand
Rapids, where I was announced for Tuesday. My<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
horse was in the meantime undergoing new and
vigorous treatment which I hoped would permanently
cure him.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Second Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Grand Central Hotel</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">South Bend, Indiana</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>August Twenty-first</i>.  </div>
<p>At ten o'clock I left Paw Paw, reached Decatur at
noon, registered at the Duncombe House and then
continued my journey by rail. I hardly realized that
I was out of Michigan in this town on the St. Joseph,
for the river belongs to the "Wolverines" with the
exception of the capricious South Bend, and the streets
have the breadth and abundance of shade that have
won so much admiration for the cities of Michigan.
It has, besides, the Hoosier enterprise, and began to
be an important manufacturing place fifteen years ago.
The first settlement began in 1831 with a handful of
houses and a population of a hundred souls. It has
now reached over 10,000. Prominent among the resources
to which its growth may be attributed is its
proximity to the hard-wood forests of Northern
Indiana and Michigan.</p>
<p>These woods have proven a bonanza to South
Bend. Enterprising manufacturers have drawn from
their unfailing source; prominent among them being
the Studebaker Brothers, who have had an enviable
career. These enterprising men started in 1852
with a cash capital of sixty-eight dollars, and a
knowledge of blacksmithing which they had acquired
at their father's forge on the Ohio. Thus equipped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
they went to work, turning out two wagons the first
year. The present output makes that humble
beginning seem almost incredible. Studebaker's
wagons are famous and the firm controls capital stock
amounting to a million of dollars. The other notable
enterprise is the Oliver Chilled Plow Works, founded
in 1853 by James Oliver, a Scotchman, who came to
Indiana to follow the vocation of an iron master, and
who ultimately had the satisfaction of exporting his
manufactures to his native country.</p>
<p>The most distinguished citizen of South Bend at
the time of my visit, and the most prominent man in
Indiana, was Hon. Schuyler Colfax, whose career as a
statesman was a singularly brilliant one. For over a
quarter of a century he had been eminent in state and
national politics. Beginning life as an editor he
founded in 1845 the <i>St. Joseph Valley Register</i>,
an organ of considerable popularity and which at
the time had a strong influence in local Whig circles.
His subsequent duties as Speaker of the House of
Representatives and the friend and adviser of Lincoln,
kept him out of editorial work, and later he was
entirely engrossed with affairs of state. In 1868 he
was elected to the office of Vice-President under
General Grant as chief executive.</p>
<h4>One Hundred and Third Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Sweet's Hotel</i>,      </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Grand Rapids, Michigan,</span></div>
<div class="signature"><i>August Twenty-second.</i>   </div>
<p>My birthday. Went by rail from South Bend to
Kalamazoo in the morning; had dinner at the latter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
place, and then caught an early train for Grand
Rapids, where, finding that George had made unusually
good arrangements, I spoke in Luce's Hall to
one of the largest audiences which greeted me in
Michigan, General W. P. Innes, well known in
Grand Army circles and a mason of high rank, introducing
me. A large and strongly executed painting
of the Battle of Lookout Mountain, stretching across
the rear of the platform, made a striking effect and
gave zest to my reference to the War for the Union.</p>
<p>My reception at this place was so hearty that I
should have enjoyed a longer visit; but plans already
laid prevented. I knew the town itself well, for I
had previously been there. It is full of interest both
on account of its past history and its present activity.
The city lies on both sides of the Grand River and
seems to be hedged in by the great bluffs that reach
along at the water edge of the valley two miles apart.
Below is a stratum of limestone rock, forming the bed
of the river, for about a mile and a half with a descent
of eighteen feet causing the rapids and supplying
the water-power. Gypsum is quarried here in large
quantities, and this industry supplemented by manufactures
and fruit culture gives it its commercial importance.
Perhaps its most striking peculiarity is to
be found in the large proportion of Hollanders who
swell the population. Their churches, their newspapers
and their general thrift give them a high
standing in the community, and what they have ever
been accorded—a reputation for being loyal and enterprising
citizens.</p>
<p>In 1760 there was a very different state of things
here. The Ottawa Indians had a large village below<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
the rapids, and there Pontiac's voice was heard, calling
upon the chiefs to aid him in his projected siege
of Detroit. Here the fur traders had their grand depot,
and the missionaries labored in the cause of
Christianity; and when in 1834 the Indian settlement
began its metamorphosis, some bold prophet declared
that it would soon be "the brightest star in the constellation
of western villages." This prophecy has
been more than fulfilled, for Grand Rapids is the acknowledged
metropolis of Western Michigan. In the
mail that awaited me was a copy of the South Bend
<i>Herald</i>, containing a pleasant notice which chronicled
in true newspaper diction the fact that</p>
<blockquote><div><p>"Captain Glazier delivered his lecture 'Echoes from the Revolution'
at the Academy of Music last evening. Promptly at eight o'clock
the lecturer, with Mr. J. F. Creed, appeared on the platform. Mr.
Creed in introducing the lecturer stated the object of the lecture to
be in aid of the Custer Monument Association of Monroe, Michigan.
He also read several letters introducing Captain Glazier to the public,
from well-known citizens of Michigan, and acknowledging receipts
of the proceeds of the lectures delivered in Detroit and Kalamazoo.
The theme of the lecturer afforded a fine field for the display of his
talents as a speaker. Possessing a fine imagination, good descriptive
powers and the real qualities of an orator, he could not fail to please
the really intelligent audience which greeted him last evening.
Probably one hour and a half were consumed in its delivery; but the
interest and attention did not flag nor tire, and when the speaker
took leave of his audience he was greeted with several rounds of applause."</p></div></blockquote>
<h4>One Hundred and Fourth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Duncombe House</i>,  </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Decatur, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>August Twenty-third</i>.</div>
<p>Came down from Grand Rapids in the morning intending
to stop on the way at Lawton, but was carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
by through the carelessness of a brakeman who neglected
to announce the stations. The town is quite an
important point on the road for its size owing to the
extensive fruit orchards of the surrounding farms.
This common industry which has sprung up in all
parts of the State, but especially in the southern portion,
and which attracts more attention than anything
else, is a contradiction to the statements of those who
examined the country while it was yet a wilderness.</p>
<p>In 1815 the surveyor-general of Ohio made a
journey through the State and soberly reported that
not more than one acre in a thousand in Southern
Michigan would in any case admit of cultivation,
yet notwithstanding that worthy's opinion, six hundred
thousand peach trees flourished in Southwestern
Michigan in 1872! Surely that is a fact to
be proud of. On my arrival at Decatur I found the
<i>Eagle</i> of Grand Rapids, containing mention of my
lecture at that place as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div><p>"A very large audience gathered at Luce's Hall last night to hear
Captain Willard Glazier. The speaker was earnest and impassioned,
his lecture was delivered with a force and eloquence that pleased his
hearers, and all who were in the hall went away glad that they had
been there, and ready to add to the praises that have been bestowed
on Captain Glazier as soldier, author and orator."</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Such notices were gratifying—not for the leaven of
flattery which they contained, but because they helped
along the cause which was to raise a shaft to the
deserving dead. For this reason I appreciated the
comments of the press and owed much to its co-operation.
It is a pleasure to me to acknowledge my
indebtedness to this most powerful agent of modern
times.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>
<h4>One Hundred and Fifth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Dyckman House</i>,    <br>
<span class="smcap">Paw Paw, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>August Twenty-fourth</i>.</div>
<p>Took the Michigan Central to Lawton, and changing
cars there continued my journey to this place by
the Paw Paw Road. Thinking that it might facilitate
matters, I had my saddle padded here, and had a talk
with the saddler besides, as the delay was becoming
serious. At this crisis, if man and horse could have
set up a partnership, like the fabled Centaurs, how
we could have flown before the wind—or even outstripped
the Michigan Central—as we galloped across
country towards the setting sun! That old myth was
an inspiration. Was it invented by some fanciful
traveller-horseman hindered on his way to Rome or
Athens, by a saddler or a veterinary surgeon?</p>
<p>During my forced visit, the people of Paw Paw
were very kind, making the time pass agreeably and
giving me a pleasant recollection to take away. These
small social influences carried great weight with them,
and helped to bear out the universally acknowledged
fact that associations are all powerful.</p>
<p>It is not strange that people, rather than their abode
or works, strongly impress themselves, nor that, realizing
this, they should be cordial in their hospitality.
If, then, I praise the beauty or enterprise of
these American towns, I bear witness at the same time,
to the kindness and courtesy of their inhabitants.
Whether East or West, these qualities were everywhere
apparent, proving the universality of generous feeling.</p>

<h4>One Hundred and Sixth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Private House</i>,   <br>
<span class="smcap">Niles, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>August Twenty-fifth</i>.</div>
<p>Leaving Paw Paw after breakfast I went down to
Lawton by rail, where I changed cars, taking the
Michigan Central to Niles, this for the purpose of
making use of the extra time that now hung heavily
upon my hands. A good proportion of the six thousand
inhabitants came to Kellogg Hall in the evening
to manifest their interest in the Custer Monument and
the old Revolutionary heroes, Mr. J. T. Head giving
the introduction.</p>
<p>Reaching Niles before noon I had ample time to
look about, and to hear from old residents something
of Berrien County and their home here on the St.
Joseph.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a></span></p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption40">NO ROOMS TO LET.</span>
</div>
<p>For those who delight in searching out events from
the doubtful past, there is suggestion enough here to
keep them occupied for at least a week. Even this
small town possesses records that date back to 1669,
when Pere Allouez came along down the river on a
voyage of discovery and who may have encamped on
the very site of Niles, for all that the people who live
there now know. But putting this aside, it is certain
that in 1700 the Jesuits had a mission a short distance
south of the present city, and that there were forts
built here and there in the vicinity as a protection
against the Indians. Later, when matters were settled
and the English and French had long since withdrawn,
the Reverend Isaac McCoy came out into the wilderness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
with his family and established Cary Mission,
probably in sight of where the old Jesuit Mission stood.
This was in 1820. Six years afterwards a handful of
cabins made their appearance, and out of this nucleus
the town of Niles was evolved. This is a mere outline
without the adornment of those pleasant little
fictions that cling about the sober history of every inhabited
place on earth, and which delight the ear of
most travellers, for there may be those who follow me
who echo the sentiment of the Michigan pioneer,
"From legend and romance, good Lord, deliver us!"</p>
<h4>One Hundred and Seventh Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Private House</i>,    <br>
<span class="smcap">La Porte, Indiana</span>,<br>
<i>August Twenty-sixth</i>.</div>
<p>Was compelled to avail myself of livery accommodations
in order to meet my evening engagement at
La Porte. Rode in a hack to South Bend, and finally
reached my destination by way of the Michigan Central
and Southern Indiana roads. My advance agent,
Babcock, met me at the station, and I accompanied
him to the home of a Mr. Munday, who I discovered
was the father of an old fellow-prisoner at "Libby."</p>
<p>I was delighted with the situation and appearance
of the town. It rises on the border of a beautiful
and fruitful prairie, its northern end bounded by a
chain of seven lakes which make an ideal resort in
summer, and is at a sufficient distance from the great
body of water which dips down into that corner of
the State, to enjoy a comparatively mild climate. Its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
population is about 8,000, of which a good share is
employed in the foundries, machine shops and mills
that make up its business activity. The younger element
is provided for in good schools, and that luxury of
modern communities—the public library—is zealously
supported. On a line with it, as a free and instructive
institution, the Natural History Association, founded
in 1863, holds an honored place, and unlike most societies
of a similar character has succeeded in making
its researches of interest. In fact for its size the city
has made great progress in literary and educational
directions.</p>
<h4>One Hundred and Eighth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Jewell House</i>,      </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Michigan City, Indiana</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>August Twenty-seventh</i>.</div>
<p>After my lecture of the previous evening at La
Porte, I took the first train to this city—emphatically
the City of Sand. Time and winds have raised great
hills of sand on every side, and from their crests one
can look off for miles over the lake, getting perhaps a
deeper impression of its vastness than from a less
monotonous lookout.</p>
<p>These sand dunes are supposed by some to be caused
by a peculiar meteorological phenomena of currents
and counter-currents acting vertically instead of horizontally.
Whatever the cause, they have made
Indiana's only port of entry a place of such striking peculiarity,
that, once seen, I doubt if it would ever be
forgotten.</p>
<p>In the forenoon I went out on the lake in a small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
yacht; but finding the little craft unequal to the heavy
waves which were rushing in from the north, I soon
turned back, having gained by the venture a better
idea of the dunes and of their extent as they stretch
along the western shore.</p>
<p>The fact that they are "building upon the sand"
gives the people of Michigan City very little concern,
probably because they know there is <i>terra firma</i> somewhere
beneath their foundations.</p>
<p>Ames College occupies a site here, and the Car Shops
are important and extensive.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Ninth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Duncombe House</i>,   <br>
<span class="smcap">Decatur, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>August Twenty-eighth</i>.</div>
<p>Taking an early train, I returned to this place in
the morning, where I had decided to remain for a few
days in order to allow more time for the treatment of
my horse, and to give my brother and Babcock an
opportunity to insure a full house at Farwell Hall,
Chicago, where I was announced to lecture on the
eleventh of September.</p>
<p>I had begun to fear that the irritation on <i>Paul's</i>
back would develop into that most disgusting and
painful disease of horses known as fistula; and although
he never showed any impatience, I had not
the heart to ride him while in this condition.</p>
<p>My quarters were quite comfortable at the only
hotel in town, and I thanked my stars that I was not
stranded in some little backwoods place with the choice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
of "the softest boards on the floor for a bed," and
other accommodations to match—a state of affairs which
a waylaid journeyman once had to face, who, with the
soul of a Stoic, left on his window-pane the comforting
couplet:</p>
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Learn hence, young man, and teach it to your sons:</span><br>
<span class="i0">The easiest way's to take it as it comes."</span>
</div>
<p>In fact I was doubly fortunate. No sooner had I
reached Decatur than I lost the consciousness of being
"a stranger within the gates," having been so cordially
made to feel that I was among friends, and that the
cause which I had taken up in Michigan met with
their hearty sympathy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a></span></p>

<div class="signature"><i>Duncombe House</i>,   <br>
<span class="smcap">Decatur, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>August Twenty-ninth</i>.</div>
<p>Met George L. Darby, an old comrade of the
"Harris Light," in the afternoon. He had noticed my
signature on the hotel register, and came at once to my
room, where after the heartiest of greetings we sat
down for a long talk. Thirteen years had slipped away
since the time of our capture at New Baltimore, Virginia,
which led him to Belle Isle and me to Libby
Prison, and yet as we discussed it all, the reality of
those events seemed undiminished. Kilpatrick, Stuart,
Fitzhugh Lee—their clever manœuvring, and our
own unfortunate experiences on that day, kept us as
enthusiastically occupied as though it were not an old
story: but soldiers may be pardoned for recurring to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
those events which, while they impressed themselves
upon witnesses with indelible distinctness, may yet have
lost their bitterness, when it is remembered that before
many years they and their stories will have passed
away. To those who indulge in the absurd belief that
such topics are discussed with malicious intent, no
justification need be made.</p>
<p>Led on from one thing to another, I found Darby
finally plying me with questions of kindly interest
about my peaceful march from Ocean to Ocean, and
anxiously asking about my horse, which I had previously
left in his care. He offered to do all he could
for the animal and with this comforting assurance took
his leave.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Eleventh Day.</h4>

<span class="smcap">Decatur, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>August Thirtieth</i>.    </div>
<p>Early in the afternoon Darby called with fishing
tackle and proposed that we go out to Lake of the
Woods and try our luck with hook and line. The
expedition was not successful as far as fish was concerned,
but we had a delightful boat ride and plenty
of talk.</p>
<p>The lake, a pretty little dot lying, as its name
implies, in the heart of the woods, is an ideal spot for
rest and enjoyment, and its miniature dimensions bear
no resemblance to its famed namesake of Minnesota.
As we had such poor success with our tackle I took no
note of the kind of fish that make their home within
its sleepy borders, and my companion gave me very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
little information. The truth is, we were more interested
in our concerns and the serious affairs outside the
sport which so fascinated Izak Walton.</p>

<p>Albert W. Rogers, to whom I had been previously
introduced, called late in the afternoon, and invited
me to drive with him, determined, he told me, that I
should see something of Decatur's surroundings. The
time was favorable for agreeable impressions. It had
been a typical summer day, with blue sky, a slight
breeze and the mercury at 70°; in short, just such
weather as I had encountered in this section of Michigan
throughout the month of August, and as evening
approached, I was prepared to enjoy to the utmost
the pleasure which my new acquaintance had provided.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a></span></p>

</div>
<p>On the outskirts of the town one gets a view of
gently rolling country under a splendid state of cultivation,
the yellow of the grain fields predominating,
and dotted here and there with farmhouses. Dark
outlines against the horizon suggested the forests of
oak, ash, maple, birch and elm, which stretch over
such large tracts of Van Buren County, and which
have made a little paradise for lumbermen. Wheat,
maize and hay appeared to be nourishing; but I
believe that agricultural products do their best in the
rich bottom-lands bordering the rivers. I have
dwelt so enthusiastically upon this fertile country that
to say more would seem extravagant, so I will bring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
my note, the chronicle of a most delightful day, to a
close.</p>
<h4>One Hundred and Thirteenth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Duncombe House</i>,   <br>
<span class="smcap">Decatur, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>September First</i>.     </div>
<p>Received and answered a large mail after breakfast,
and in the afternoon took a walk through the village.
One is, of course, reminded of the gallant Commodore
whose name, once among the greatest in America, now
honors this modest Western town, and whose deeds,
once upon every lip in the young republic, are wellnigh
forgotten. The question even suggests itself as
to how many of those who live here, where his name
is perpetuated, are familiar with his life and character.</p>
<p>His capture of the frigate <i>Philadelphia</i>, which had
been seized and held in the harbor of Tripoli in
1801, during the pacha's seizure of our merchantmen,
was said by Admiral Nelson to be "the most daring
act of the age," and his diplomacy at Algiers and
Tunis and Tripoli, where in 1812 his demands were
acceded to, received the applause of all Christendom,
especially because those demands included the release
of the Christian captives at Algiers and of the Danish
and Neapolitan prisoners at Tripoli, and ended, forever,
the pretensions of the Barbary powers.</p>
<p>After the trial of Commodore Barron for cowardice,
Decatur made some remarks which the former thought
should not be allowed to pass unnoticed, and accordingly
called upon his accuser to retract them. This
Decatur refused to do, but attempted to bring about a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
reconciliation. Barren refused this and threw down
the gauntlet, and when shortly afterwards the two
met to settle the difficulty "with honor," both fell at
the word "Fire!"—Decatur mortally wounded. The
affair was universally deplored, for his loyal services
had endeared Decatur to his country, and when his
remains were taken to the grave, they were followed
by the largest concourse of people that had ever assembled
in Washington.</p>
<h4>One Hundred and Fourteenth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Duncombe House</i>,   <br>
<span class="smcap">Decatur, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>September Second</i>.    </div>
<p>This was a great day for Decatur. With the morning
came the completion of arrangements for a Republican
mass-meeting, and a rustic band from an adjacent
village arrived at nine o'clock in a farm wagon.
The "Stars and Stripes" floated majestically over the
heads of the patriotic musicians, and the people were
drawn from every quarter to the stirring call of fife
and drum, eager to see their leaders and to listen to
their views upon the vital questions of the day. The
"Silver Cornet Band" of Dowagiac co-operated with
the "Decatur Fife and Drum Corps," in rousing the
dormant element of the place, and, as its imposing appellation
would imply, did so with dignified and classical
selections.</p>
<p>The political campaign which had been slumbering
since the nomination of Hayes and Tilden reached an
interesting stage of its progress at this time, and the
friends and champions of the rival candidates were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
fully alive to the issues of their respective platforms.</p>
<p>By nightfall the place was the scene of great activity,
and to an onlooker produced a singular effect.
Men were collected in groups engaged in excited conversation,
torches flared in every direction, while at
brief intervals all voices were drowned in some lively
tune from the silver cornets or the fife and drum.</p>
<p>At an appointed hour the speakers of the evening
appeared, and I noticed among them Hon. Ransom
H. Nutting and Hon. Thomas W. Keightly—the
latter a candidate for Congress from this district. The
meeting closed at a late hour, after a succession of
heated addresses, and yet the politicians of Van Buren
County seemed not at all averse to continuing their
talking until sunrise.</p>
<h4>One hundred and fifteenth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Duncombe House</i>,   <br>
<span class="smcap">Decatur, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>September Third</i>.      </div>
<p>Accepting an invitation from Albert Rogers, I accompanied
him to the Presbyterian Church in the
morning, where Rev. Mr. Hoyt, a young clergyman,
conducted the services and preached a very good sermon.
I was pleased by the courtesy extended me
when he said, in the course of his announcements. "I
take pleasure in calling attention to Captain Glazier's
lecture at Union Hall to-morrow night. I shall be
present myself, and recommend all who wish to listen
to an instructive and patriotic lecture to be at the hall
before eight o'clock." When the service was over Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Rogers and I waited to have a few words with Mr.
Hoyt, who was evidently very much interested in my
journey across country and who intended to lend his
influence in behalf of the "Monument Fund." We
then returned to the hotel where I passed the remainder
of the day quietly in my room.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Sixteenth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Duncombe House</i>,   <br>
<span class="smcap">Decatur, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>September Fourth</i>.   </div>
<p>Lectured to a full house at Union Hall in the evening.
My sojourn of a week at this place and the interest
felt in the effort to perpetuate the memory of
Custer, brought about the most gratifying results.
Among those who were with me on the platform were
Hon. Ransom Nutting, Rev. Mr. Hoyt, Prof. Samuel
G. Burked and Albert W. Rogers. I was presented
by Mr. Nutting, after which testimonials from the
Monument Association were read by Prof. Burked,
and later the following pleasant acknowledgment
from these gentlemen was handed me:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Decatur, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>September 4, 1876</i>.</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Captain Willard Glazier,</span>
</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir:</span> We take this means of expressing to you our appreciation
of the highly instructive and very entertaining lecture
delivered by you at Union Hall this evening. Truly we admire your
plan and your generosity in giving the entire proceeds to the Custer
Monument Fund. Our endorsement is the expression of our village
people generally. You have made many friends here.</p>
<p>May success attend you throughout your journey.</p>
<div class="signature3">Very respectfully,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">S. Gordon Burked,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Ransom Nutting,  </span><br>
<span class="smcap">Albert W. Rogers.</span></div>
</div></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>
<p>Such greeting as this, extended to me all along my
way, gives substantial proof of the universal kindness
with which I was received, and of the spontaneous hospitality
of the American citizen.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Seventeenth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Seymour House</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Dowagiac, Michigan</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>September Fifth</i>.</div>
<p>There was a large gathering in front of the Duncombe
House in the morning when I mounted <i>Paul</i>
and faced westward, turning my back upon the hospitable
little village in which I had spent so many
pleasant days, and where I felt that I had indeed
made many friends. Mr. Rogers and a young man
of the place, whose name I am sorry to have forgotten,
escorted me out of town intending to ride with me to
Dowagiac, but an approaching rain-storm obliged
them to turn back. As I came in sight of the village
I noticed unmistakable signs of a stream which I discovered
was the Dowagiac River, a tributary of the
St. Joseph, entering it near Niles. It has been put to
good account by the millers, who have established
themselves here, and in its small way adds to the
blessings of the Michigan husbandmen on its shores.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Eighteenth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Private House</i>,   <br>
<span class="smcap">Niles, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>September Sixth</i>.  </div>
<p>The threatening storm which led my Decatur friends
to turn back on the previous afternoon, set in soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
after my arrival at Dowagiac, and I considered myself
very fortunate, as it was accompanied by the most
violent thunder and lightning that I had yet encountered.
Notwithstanding this disturbed condition of
the elements, I was greeted by a full house at Young
Men's Hall, where I was introduced by Dr. Thomas
Rix.</p>
<p>I found a few familiar faces at Niles which I had
seen during my previous visit, and several new places
of interest about the town. Navigation on the St.
Joseph ends at this point, and the narrowed stream is
spanned by a railroad bridge; and the water-power increased
by a dam. There is a brisk business carried
on at the water's edge.</p>
<p>The mills are well supplied with grain from outlying
fields, and boats are continually plying back and
forth laden with lumber, grain, flour and fruit, which
are shipped from here in large quantities. In fact, for
its size—it claims I believe, a population of something
over 4,000—Niles is full of energy and ambition. I
found myself on this second visit very much interested
in the place and pleased that circumstances had made
necessary a second halt.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Nineteenth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Konnard House</i>,      <br>
<span class="smcap">Buchanan, Michigan</span>,<br>
<i>September Seventh</i>.     </div>
<p>Resumed my journey at two o'clock in the afternoon
at a small way place between Niles and Buchanan,
where I rested at noon. The heavy rains of
the preceding days had left the roads in a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
wretched condition, and the distance was considerably
lengthened as it was necessary to avoid pools and washouts,
so that it took two hours of slow riding to reach
my destination. Darby, who had gone forward with
my advance agents, was the first to greet me at this
place and to inform me of the arrangements made for
my lecture in the evening.</p>
<p>As my day's journey had been undertaken leisurely,
I started out on a tour of inspection, after having first
made comfortable provision for <i>Paul</i>. I found a
flourishing village, having a population of something
over 2,000, and prettily situated on the St. Joseph
River. As I walked in and out through its streets
and looked for the last time upon the stream, which
for its romantic history and natural charm had forced
itself upon my notice so often, I could not avoid a
certain feeling of regret that this was to be my last
halt in the great State through which I had made such
a pleasant and profitable journey. Pictures of orchard
and meadow, of wheat field and river, passed in review
once more, and with them the recollection of the
splendid part the patriots of Michigan bore in the
War for the Union, than whom was none more loyal
than the heroic Custer, for whose memory I had spoken
and received such warm response.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Twentieth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Private House</i>,      </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Rolling Prairie, Indiana</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>September Eighth</i>.  </div>
<p>Called for my horse at Buchanan at nine o'clock in
the morning, intending to stop at New Buffalo, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
once on the road, I decided instead to make this
village my evening objective. A heavy rain-storm,
setting in early in the forenoon, compelled me to take
refuge at a farm house for about an hour, where I was
initiated into the home life of the Northern Indiana
"Hoosier." I am sorry to say that during this day's
ride I encountered the worst roads and the dullest
people of my journey. Many who have resided in
this part of Indiana for thirty and even forty years
are not only exceedingly illiterate, but know much
less of the topography of the country than the average
Indian—and absolutely nothing of the adjacent towns.
As a consequence I was obliged to trust to chance,
which brought me to Galion, a tiny hamlet on the
outskirts of a swamp, where I had dinner. My ride
thither was made under circumstances which suggested
the ride of the belated Tam O'Shanter, and while my
tortures could not compare with his, they were none
the less acute while they lasted. I was met on the
edge of the swamp by a swarm of mosquitoes—known
in France as <i>petite diables</i>—who forced their attention
upon me without cessation, in spite of the fact that I
urged my horse forward at breakneck speed, <i>Paul's</i>
steaming flanks and mire-covered legs attesting to the
struggle, when we drew up in front of Galion Inn.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a></span></p>

<div class="signature"><i>September Ninth</i>.      </div>
<p>I considered myself fortunate, during my ride from
Rolling Prairie to Michigan City—a distance of sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
miles—in having a sandy road and no rain from
the time of setting out in the morning until my arrival
here in the evening, but I was less favored
than usual in obtaining information.</p>
<p>The Presidential campaign was now at white heat
and very little outside of politics was discussed. I found,
however, that the ideas of many of the farmers were
confused upon the issues. The three candidates in
the field made the canvass unusually exciting. Hayes
and Tilden were, of course, the central figures, but
Peter Cooper of New York had many staunch supporters
and a few enthusiasts rallied around Blaine,
Conkling and Morton. The proprietor of the Jewell
House—a Cooper man—was at this time much more
interested in the success of his favorite than in the receipts
of his hotel, and his halls and parlors were the
rendezvous for men of all parties.</p>

<div class="signature"><i>September Tenth</i>.     </div>
<p>As it was Sunday and I had a desire to visit the
most imposing institution connected with Michigan
City—the Northern State Penitentiary, I decided to
make the two miles on foot, and be there for divine
service. I found everything admirably conducted,
and although such a place is not the most cheerful in
the world to be shown through, I was well satisfied
that I had gone, and was strongly impressed with the
effect of the stern hand of the law. In the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
a heavy rain and wind storm came up, and I stayed in
my room, the greater part of the time, writing up my
journal, and arranging for my lecture tour across
Illinois and Iowa, thereby accomplishing certain
duties which fair weather might have tempted me to
neglect.</p>
<p>It was my intention to go by rail to Chicago on the
following morning, where I was announced to lecture
at Farwell Hall.</p>
<p>Darby, to whom I have previously referred in connection
with Decatur, and who was acting as advance
agent in the small towns and villages that lay along
my route, was with me during my stay at the Jewell
House, and we had frequent talks over our adventures
in the "Harris Light"—Second New York Cavalry—in
which most of our active service was passed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>THREE DAYS AT CHICAGO.</h3>
<p>On the eleventh of September, I took
the 7.50 morning train at Michigan
City for Chicago, instead of going forward
on horseback, as I had discovered
by a study of the map of Illinois, that
I could save <i>Paul</i> some thirty miles,
in my journey across the State, by
riding directly from Michigan City to
Joliet, and I saw no good reason why
I should ride him up here, especially at a time when
he was greatly in need of rest.</p>
<p>When I had registered at the "Grand Pacific," I
went to the Fidelity Safe Deposit Company to attend
to some business matters and then over to the Express
and Post offices, concluding my rounds by a call upon
friends on West Washington street.</p>
<p>Lectured to a full house at Farwell Hall in the
evening, the introduction being given by Major E. S.
Weedon, editor of the <i>Army and Navy Gazette</i>. The
Major alluded in eloquent and touching terms to the
record of the gallant Custer and immediately put my
audience in sympathy with me. My brother-in-law,
Madison H. Buck, of Lake Mills, Wisconsin, called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
upon me in the evening and was with me on the platform.
The lecture closed before ten o'clock, and I
hurried over to McVicker's Theatre, to see the last acts
of "Mulberry Sellers," in which John T. Raymond
was playing his favorite rôle. The play was having
quite a run, and one heard at every turn the expression
that had caught the popular fancy—Mulberry's
inimitable assurance, "There's millions in it!"</p>
<p>On the morning of the twelfth, I settled with George
and Babcock. The former went forward to Ottawa,
and the latter to Joliet. It was my intention at the
time to push on to Omaha and Cheyenne as rapidly
as possible in the hope of passing Sherman, at the
summit of the mountains, before the snow was too
deep to interrupt my journey. Eight general halts
had been decided upon between Boston and San Francisco,
and these were Albany, Buffalo, Toledo, Chicago,
Omaha, Cheyenne, Ogden, and Sacramento. I
had now reached my fourth objective and felt the
importance of more haste and less leisure and sightseeing.
My time, therefore, in this great city was necessarily
cut short.</p>
<p>The Exposition had just opened at the time I
reached Chicago, and this enabled me to see more in a
few hours than I could have possibly seen in any other
way, and gave me quite an idea of the industries
carried on in Cook County.</p>
<p>I had never seen a finer local affair of the kind
and was confident that its object—the encouragement
of agriculture and industry—would be successfully accomplished.
Anyone who sees the way in which
Chicagoans throw themselves into an undertaking of
this sort, and in fact into everything that has to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
with the enterprise or prosperity of their city, cannot
but be struck with admiration.</p>
<p>Their irrepressible hopefulness, which effected such
marvelous results after the great conflagration of 1871,
is a case in point, and those who have been fortunate
enough to see the transformation, are forced to admit
that the calamity was, after all, not so much to be deplored.
Out of the great waste in which the business
portion was laid, handsome buildings have sprung up
with almost magic rapidity and auguring well for the
future of the "Windy City." Especially is this
feature striking in the vicinity of the City Hall, where
finer edifices rose upon the old ruins.</p>
<p>The very name of Chicago carries us back to the
barbaric scenes of more than two hundred years
ago. Where the beautiful city now stands, those days
of long since past knew only a morass, an oozy, desolate
stretch of water-soaked swamp. There was a
stream in this desolate region, the banks of which,
tradition tells us, were parched and cracked and blackened
by the frequent ravages of lightning. The
early explorers found on its banks an old stone mound,
supposed to have been erected for the sacrifice of human
victims to propitiate the wrath of the Indian deity
Chekagua, the Thunder God.</p>
<p>On the oldest map of this region now extant, one
published in 1684, the little river itself bears the
name Chekagua, and it may be, that our fair Western
metropolis of to-day was also a namesake of that same
weird divinity.</p>
<p>Others, claiming a more propitious christening, assert
that Chicago was a derivative from Chacaqua, the
Indian term for the Divine River.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>
<p>Or perhaps the city was named from the successive
titles of the proud, old Tamawas Chiefs.</p>
<p>"Not a monarch in all that proud Old World beyond
the deep" bore more haughtily his inherited title of
Herod or Caesar than did one of these Tamawas
rulers exult in the ancient title of Chacaqua. If this
theory of the origin of Chicago's cognomen be accepted,
then indeed can the "Windy City" claim a royal title
from the first.</p>
<p>In 1673, certain Catholic missionaries became interested
in exploring the Western Wilds. They were especially
enthusiastic in regard to the waterways of
darkest America. The Mississippi they had heard of.
Was it possible that it ever could be made to join
hands with the Great Lakes, of which they had some
knowledge?</p>
<p>So questioning, Fathers Marquette and Joliet took
two canoes and five men from the upper lake regions,
and started to explore the charming Valley of the
Mississippi.</p>
<p>On their return they reached the mouth of the
Illinois, where they were informed of a new way of
reaching Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>"Taking the Des Plaines branch, they were able to
reach the water shed, but eight feet higher than canoeable
waters, crossing which they launched into the
stream which conducted them into the lake."</p>
<p>In so doing they made perhaps the greatest discovery
of their time—namely, a discovery of that supremely
important portage which insures Chicago's
supremacy so long as American civilization exists.</p>
<p>In October, 1674, Marquette returned to this spot
and erected the first white man's dwelling which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
was ordained to be the beginning of the great metropolis
of the West. His little hut was both a home and
a sanctuary. Here he wintered, shooting turkey, deer
and buffalo from his door. Here in the spring, from
toil and exposure, he died, mourned by the savages
whom he had taught.</p>
<p>Thus was Chicago begun in embryo.</p>
<p>There in that lagoon, filled with ooze, with its
impassable fens, and drifting sands, civilization and
religion had their representative who laid the foundation
of the great Coming City bravely with teachings
of "The love of God, and the brotherhood of man."</p>
<p>We have good maps of 1688 which show us that a
little later this lake end of the water communication
with Louisiana was made a military post, called Fort
Chicagon.</p>
<p>This place became at one time a favorite settlement
for French missionaries. However the spot is supposed
to have been abandoned about 1763, after which
date for about one hundred years white men avoided
it.</p>
<p>In 1774 the site of Chicago, with all the surrounding
country, became a part of Virginia, being conquered
by a military expedition from that State.</p>
<p>In 1778 the region became known as County of
Illinois, State of Virginia.</p>
<p>After the close of the Revolutionary war, Virginia
"divided herself by the Ohio River," ceding all the
territory beyond that boundary to the United States
for the "common benefit of all the people."</p>
<p>In 1795 the Indians also ceded to the general
government any rights which their tribes possessed to
"one piece of land six miles square, at the mouth of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Chekajo River, emptying into the southwest end of
Lake Michigan, where a fort formerly stood." This
extinguishment of the Indian title in 1795, being in
the nature of a quit-claim deed for lands, is sometimes
called the earliest real estate transaction in
Chicago.</p>
<p>Thus, she who was to become the "Queen City" of
the West, made her <i>debut</i> into the Union, where,
possibly, she may yet,</p>
<div class="center">"The fairest of her daughters,"</div>
<p>rule supreme.</p>
<p>In the midst of all the down-town rush, at a point
where noise and confusion scarcely cease, one notices
upon a decidedly modern building a white stone tablet
which informs the stranger that it was upon this spot
Fort Dearborn stood—the oldest landmark that remained
to tell the tale of the wilderness. In 1804 two
block-houses were built here and a subterranean passage
made from the parade to the river, the whole surrounded
by a picket and furnished with three pieces
of light artillery, the object being "to supply the
Indian wants and control the Indian policy." The
tribes of Pottawatomies overran the country round
about and with the little group of French and Canadian
settlers made the life of the isolated post. In
1809 Tecumseh marked it out as one of his objects of
vengeance, but fortunately other schemes occupied his
attention, and it remained in comparative security until
the war of 1812. Then, when all the country was
disturbed and the Indians were making mischief
everywhere, the commander of Fort Dearborn was betrayed
by the Pottawatomies and every vestige of a
settlement destroyed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>
<p>It was not until 1818, after Fort Dearborn was
again demolished, that the pale face was courageous
enough to establish his home at this point. Nor was
courage alone required, for the unfavorable position—on
a morass where vehicles invariably floundered in
its black loam, and where the air was necessarily unhealthy—was
well known; but these first men whose
rude homes constituted the embryo city must have
possessed to a great degree that indomitable spirit
which has become the very foundation of Chicago.</p>
<p>Nine years from this time a most unfavorable report
of the place was sent to the Government and from
this report the picture is called up of a wretched, unclean
and disreputable community. But this state of
affairs was not to last long. An event of importance
took place here in 1833, when the United States commissioners
and chiefs of the Pottawatomie, Chippewa
and Ottawa tribes met, that the former might persuade
the latter to give up more of their valuable land
in Illinois and Michigan and ultimately to relinquish
it altogether. The exact amount stipulated for was
twenty millions of acres. Then population increased,
for one of the points agreed upon, along with the land,
was that the Indians should move west of the Mississippi.
As a result, Chicago became the centre of much
speculating. Eastern capitalists were interested, invested
and lost heavily, but after the depression which
inevitably followed, the people went to work in
earnest and brought the town out of her trouble.</p>
<p>The one point of advantage that Chicago possessed—her
possibilities as a commercial post—was
put to the test, and so rapidly did she advance, that in
1842, after several remarkable advances, she sent out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
600,000 bushels of wheat. She was already becoming
a big cattle market, ranchmen further west driving
their stock here and helping to increase the importance
of the place as a centre of trade. At this time a
canal was in process of construction, to connect the
Illinois and Chicago rivers, thus making Chicago the
centre for commerce between the Southwest and East,
and giving her the opportunity to extend her business
from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>This was a splendid opening, and, with the co-operation
of the railroads which soon afterwards were extended
to this point, the future prosperity of the place
was secured. It then only remained for Chicago to
improve her appearance and sanitary condition. This
she did by having the streets drained, filled up and
graded. Local pride was manifesting itself in various
improvements and in private and public buildings, so
that by 1871 there was plenty of fuel for the great fire
which laid so much of the city waste.</p>
<p>The well-known origin of the conflagration was in
a barn where "Mrs. Scully's cow" innocently turned
over a lighted lantern on some dry hay. Soon the
barn was in flames and the fire quickly spread to the
lumber yards along the river and from thence, the dry
timber and wind favoring, leaped along and licked up
the homes on the North Side and the business
houses on the South Side.</p>
<p>The first stroke of the alarm sounded about nine
o'clock in the evening of October 8, 1871. "By eleven
o'clock 100,000 people were hurrying through the
streets of the doomed city," spreading terror as they
went. "All over the city it was as light as day, and,
in the remotest suburb fine print was read by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
glare of the conflagration three or four miles away.
By midnight nearly every vehicle in the city had
been pressed into service, and the frightened animals
attached to them, in many cases beyond control, went
flying through the streets in all directions, making a
racket and a rumble which, coupled with the hoarse
shouts of men, the moaning of the gale, the roar of the
conflagration and the crash of falling buildings made a
conglomeration of sight and sound so appalling that
none who saw it, or were of it, are ever likely to forget.
Few in the city took any notice of the break of
day or the rising of the sun. These occurrences
seemed to make little difference in the quantity of
light. It was only now and then that Old Sol was
visible through the almost impenetrable smoke clouds.
Nothing could be seen but smoke, smoke, smoke, here
and there interspersed by dark rolling masses of
flames. It was chaos come again. The earth was
seemingly resolved into its original elements."</p>
<p>At the end of three days, 300,000 people were destitute,
100,000 were absolutely homeless, 200,000 were
without water. The food supply was doubtful for all.
Robbers and incendiaries were at work. The gas was
gone—blown sky high. Churches, newspapers, police,
telegraph offices and public institutions were
gone, while nineteen-twentieths of all the mercantile
stock in the city was consumed.</p>
<p>The tract destroyed was about a mile in breadth,
and the losses were roughly estimated at $200,000,000.
Still, so alive was public sentiment and hope, that at
the time of my horseback journey, five years later,
scarcely a trace remained to tell the tale of this disaster,
and that of 1874, except the records of history.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>
<p>The story of just how Chicago proved herself a veritable
Phoenix is a very interesting one.</p>
<p>On the evening of October ninth, only twenty-four
hours after the commencement of the conflagration, a
car-load of provisions arrived from Milwaukee. By
the next morning fifty car-loads had come to the afflicted
city. Donations of food and clothing kept
pouring in until Chicago was fairly sated. By October
eleventh every person had food enough and each one's
pressing physical necessities were attended to. On the
eleventh, also, the Board of Trade met and resolved to
require the honoring of all contracts. On the twelfth
the bankers met and resolved to pay all depositors in
full. The State sent an instalment of $3,000,000
with which it then voted to re-imburse the city for its
expenditures for the canal enlargement, thus placing the
city in the possession of much-needed funds. From
all over the civilized world came contributions in
money for the resurrected city. The amount so received
within three months after the conflagration being
about $4,200,000.</p>
<p>The Relief Society alone built four thousand houses
within five weeks of those dreadful days when all
seemed lost.</p>
<p>In two years after the fire, sixty-nine million, four
hundred and sixty-two thousand dollars were expended
in erecting buildings of brick, iron, and stone, while
miles of humble frame houses were built, each costing
from $500 to $10,000.</p>
<p>Now, in place of the original city of wood, there
stands by the Great Lake, a city of stone and iron, able
to vie with any other city in growth, enterprise and
wealth, bearing the distinction of being the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
grain and lumber market in the world, and boasting a
population, at the time of my journey, of about five
hundred thousand. From the Atlantic to the Pacific
I rode into no city that made such an impression
of grandeur, business power and wealth as this
youthful "Queen of the Lakes."</p>
<p>Chicago's baptism of fire seemed but to prove an inspiration,
goading the city to more activity, to greater
success.</p>
<p>The aggregate amount of business done in the city
the year after the fire—entirely excepting the building
trades—greatly exceeds that done the previous year, as
the following figures will show. During this one year
the wholesale merchandise trade increased fifteen per
cent. Receipts of grain increased 8,425,885 bushels;
receipts of live-stock by 872,866 head. Deposits in
the city banks increased $1,910,000.</p>
<p>So much for the splendid pluck of Chicago.</p>
<p>The Pacific coast has Chicago for her smelting furnace,
four large silver mills being located here.</p>
<p>From the Pacific coast also, she has a considerable
trade in the productions of the Orient. In the first
half of 1873, Chicago received assignments of three-million
pounds of tea, two million pounds of coffee,
eight hundred thousand pounds of foreign wool, and
three hundred and nine thousand, seven hundred and
twenty four pounds of foreign silk. Cotton came to
her from the Pacific Isles, and nuts from South
America.</p>
<p>Some idea of the commercial importance of Chicago's
trade may be reached by the amount of some of
her exports by rail during 1872: namely, two hundred
and thirty-four million pounds of meat; eighty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
million, two hundred and fifty thousand pounds of
lard; one million, nine hundred and sixty-five thousand
whole swine; four hundred and eighty-four
thousand head of cattle, and one hundred and sixty-two
thousand head of sheep.</p>
<p>I found Chicago justly proud of her public schools.
It was roughly estimated that in the city about fifty
thousand children between six and twelve years of age
received daily instruction.</p>
<p>The graded system employed in these schools is so
advanced, and has proved so successful, that it has become
a general model for all the schools of the great
Northwest.</p>
<p>More than that, it has been adopted, in part, by the
Minister of Education in France, and at the late
Vienna Exposition a reward for progress, in the
shape of a beautiful medal, was awarded to the school
system of Chicago. Chicago claims for herself absolute
superiority in two particulars over all the public
schools in the United States, the "Hub" institutions
of Boston not excepted. <i>First:</i> Perfect discipline is
said to be attained without the use of corporal punishment.
<i>Second:</i> The musical culture of the school
children is said to far excel anything attained before
on this Continent.</p>
<p>I found that the city contained a number of colleges,
theological seminaries and universities. The University
of Chicago occupies one of the most elegant and
commodious buildings in the West.</p>
<p>The Dearborn Observatory, which is a part of this
University, contains the famous Clark Telescope, one
of the most magnificent instruments of its kind in
existence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>
<p>The Chicago Theological Seminary is noted for the
beauty of its chapel and lecture rooms, and the extent
and quality of its library. The Academy of Science
was incorporated in 1865. It has a vast building,
well stocked with natural curiosities.</p>
<p>The Historical Society organized in 1856 possesses
a rare collection of public and private documents, as
well as a library of nearly one hundred thousand
volumes.</p>
<p>There are two hundred and thirty-eight houses of
public worship in Chicago; all of the great religious
denominations, and perhaps some new ones, being well
represented. Differing as they do, they are, as some one
says: "Agreed on one point, namely, an uncommon
sense of mutual toleration and mutual love for each
other, and a feeling of</p>
<div class="center">Peace and sweet good will to all mankind."</div>
<p>There is a good deal of fine pulpit oratory to be
heard every Sabbath in Chicago; and the people of the
surrounding country know it. It is no uncommon
thing for the Saturday night incoming trains to be
crowded with young men, some of them from homes
one hundred miles away, who are yet regular attendants
at the religious services of the city. Having enjoyed
these to the full, the Sunday evening sleeping
cars are again crowded with the same youthful army,
very sleepy, but very happy, making the return trip.</p>
<p>Chicago is justly proud of her streets. About eighty
feet wide, and meeting at right angles, they present a
beautiful object lesson to some of her elder Eastern
sisters.</p>
<p>The city is said to contain thirteen million dollars'<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
worth of hotel property. Perhaps no structure for
which any part of this immense sum has been expended
is more beautiful and remarkable than the
Palmer House. This building is said to contain more
bricks than any two hotels on the Continent, and more
iron than most of them put together. The flooring
contains ninety thousand square feet of marble tiling
laid in massive beds of cement. The beams are laid
in beds of cement also.</p>
<p>The immense carriage court is entered by three <i>porte
cochéres</i>. There are said to be one hundred miles of
electric bell wires in the building. The magnificent
office is twenty-four feet in height. It is wainscoted
with Italian marble, studded with panels of remarkably
rich rose brocatelle marble, and with many
natural mosaics of rare and curious beauty. The
wainscoting of the counter is made of the same exquisite
material. The grand staircase is made of the
same.</p>
<p>Mr. C. M. Palmer travelled extensively for some
time, before building, throughout Europe, making an
especial study of continental hotels, with a determination
to surpass the excellences of them all in his beloved
Chicago.</p>
<p>Mr. Palmer's spirit seems to be characteristic of all
true Chicagoans. To have their city excel, to have it
something more extensive, more impressive, more famous,
grander, nobler than any other place which the
sun shines on, this is their hearts' desire. Some one
said to a great man:</p>
<p>"What paramount word of advice would you give
to young men?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>
<p>The answer came,</p>
<p>"Aspire."</p>
<p>"What would your next advice be?"</p>
<p>"Aspire."</p>
<p>"But what then?"</p>
<p>"Aspire."</p>
<p>Chicago believes in that advice. She has always
believed in it. Nay, more, she has lived it.</p>

<h3>CHICAGO TO DAVENPORT.</h3>
<h4>One hundred and Twenty-sixth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Jewell House</i>,      </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Michigan City, Indiana</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>September 14, 1876</i>.      </div>
<p>In the morning I settled with Darby, and
in the afternoon he returned to Decatur.</p>
<p>At nightfall here, the excitement
which had been rising during the day
reached its climax when the Michigan
City Democrats repaired to the New Albany
depot to hold a mass meeting.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding my own sentiments,
I went too, and was highly entertained
by the speakers, among whom were Hon. Daniel W.
Voorhees of Terre Haute, Hon. James Williams—better
known in the Hoosier State as "Blue Jeans"
Williams—and Hon. Morgan Weir, of La Porte.</p>
<p>When Voorhees arrived his enthusiastic partisans
had him driven in state from the station in a carriage
drawn by four white horses. He was no doubt the
lion of the occasion and his energetic language drew
forth frequent applause. The strong features, straight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
brows and broad forehead of this politician would proclaim
him a man of force anywhere.</p>
<p>A large crowd had gathered at the appointed place
and business began at eight o'clock. As time passed
the excitement grew more intense, and towards the
close of the meeting an amusing incident was noted,
when the honorable senator took issue with his opponents.
I then became aware that there were others
present of a different faith, besides myself, for no
sooner were Voorhees' anti-Republican sentiments
voiced than a vehement champion of the Republican
party jumped to his feet denouncing as false the statements
made, winding up his remarks by thumping his
cane on the benches and saying that all that had been
spoken was a "pack of lies!" Off in another part of
the building an excited Irishman also jumped up crying
out: "Mr. Voorhees is a perfect gintleman, sor!"
A compliment which the Hoosiers quickly took up
and the depot rang with: "Mr. Voorhees is a perfect
gintleman, sor!"</p>
<p>My co-partisan was silenced, if not convinced. The
other speakers scored several points for their cause
and the meeting closed with three cheers and a tiger
for the Democratic candidates.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Twenty-seventh Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Jewell House</i>,    </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Michigan City, Indiana</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>September Fifteenth</i>.   </div>
<p>Being detained on account of the condition of my
horse, and as the weather now was most delightful, I
made the best of the situation by looking about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
place, since I had seen comparatively little of it up to
this time. Possibly no city or town along my route
labors under greater disadvantages from a geographical
or commercial point of view than this "city of sand,"
situated as it is at the extreme southern end of Lake
Michigan, with the water splashing against it on one
side and the wind and sand storms beating against it
on the other.</p>
<p>However, it has overcome these obstacles to a certain
degree and is hardly lacking in enterprise, as the
mass meeting of the preceding day testified. Here,
perhaps, more than at any other of the towns and
cities lying around Lake Michigan, one is impressed
with the resistless force of this splendid inland sea,
and so unique an impression did the place make upon
me that my detention did not become irksome, although
all the fascinations of the Great West lay beyond.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Twenty-eighth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Hobart House</i>,  <br>
<span class="smcap">Hobart, Indiana</span>,<br>
<i>September Sixteenth</i>.</div>
<p>Did not get on the road until nearly eleven o'clock.
The rest and treatment which <i>Paul</i> had received at
Michigan City put him in excellent spirits for a rapid
journey and he stepped off nimbly when I gave him
the reins in front of the Jewell House. I was greatly
encouraged by the condition of my horse and now that
the word was once more "onward," all the fascination
of the ride came back.</p>
<p>Although the scenes I passed through were very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
like others, there being nothing of marked interest to
the traveller in this section of Indiana, I still found
much pleasure in looking over the farms as I passed
them and noticing the variety of methods and effects.</p>
<p>A good stimulating breeze came inland from the
lake and by noon it had added zest to my appetite. I
stopped for dinner at the village of Chesterton and
then pushed on to this place which was reached in the
evening by seven o'clock—twenty-eight miles having
been covered during the day.</p>
<p>The only accommodation to be found was nothing
more nor less than a beer-saloon with sleeping rooms
attached, a characteristic, I regret to say, which I observed
in many of the small towns through this section
of the country. As immediate environment has
an influence in making impressions, my opinion of
this halting-place on the borders of "Hoosierdom"
was not the most exalted.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Twenty-ninth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Rohmer House</i>,  <br>
<span class="smcap">Richton, Illinois</span>,<br>
<i>September Seventeenth</i>.</div>
<p>Owing to the late hour of my arrival at Hobart the
previous evening I was unable to observe my usual
practice of looking through the place and making a
note of its striking points in my journal, and for this
reason I was not in the saddle until ten o'clock A. M.,
although the time was spent more in seeing than in
chronicling what was seen.</p>
<p><i>Paul</i> was still in the happiest of spirits and I rode
away from Hobart at a gallop, stirring the dust of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
sleepy little village as it had possibly not been stirred
for many moons. The cheerful fact was made clear to
me before leaving that I was as far from Joliet at Hobart
as I had supposed myself to be at Michigan City.</p>
<p>In the course of the day, in which twenty-eight
miles were again covered, Centralia, Sherryville and
Dyer were passed, these towns being on Grand
Prairie, across which I rode from morning till night.
At four o'clock I reached the boundary between Indiana
and Illinois, realizing that at this point six
States had added their rich scenes and splendid enterprises
to my memory.</p>
<p>As I was moving along on the prairie just before
dark my ears caught the sound of a peculiar barking
and soon a pack of what I supposed to be dogs were
following me. I noticed that <i>Paul's</i> manner changed
and he appeared disturbed, but attributed this to the
barking and the persistent keeping at his heels of the
little animals. To a man whom I met later, I explained
that I had been followed for some hours by a
pack of dogs, when he promptly informed me that
they were doubtless prairie wolves. Of course to an
Easterner this news gave an added interest to Grand
Prairie.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a></span></p>

<h4>One hundred and Thirtieth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Robertson House</i>,  <br>
<span class="smcap">Joliet, Illinois</span>.   <br>
<i>September Eighteenth</i>.</div>
<p>Had <i>Paul</i> brought out at eight o'clock. As soon
as he was saddled at Richton the man who attended to
him threw the rein over the neck of the horse, and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
moment later he made his appearance unaccompanied
in front of the Rohmer House. This being an
undoubted sign of his anxiety to be off, I mounted at
once and we were soon lessening the distance to Joliet,
our evening destination, twenty-one miles away.</p>
<p>Was all day again on Grand Prairie, which may
give some idea of this the greatest and truly the grandest
prairie yet passed on my route. Its proximity to
Chicago is doubtless one of the chief causes of the
high winds for which the "Windy City" is noted;
and if Chicago could, she would gladly change her inconvenient
environment.</p>
<p>At Lenox I halted for dinner, reaching Joliet at
four P. M. In riding through Jefferson street, I was
met by Babcock who seemed much surprised at my
early arrival. Notwithstanding the fact that "Rip
Van Winkle" was being played at the opera house,
Robert McWade, a young actor of some prominence,
taking the leading <i>rôle</i>, I found a fair audience awaiting
me at Werner Hall in the evening, which proved
that interest was still felt in the Custer Monument
movement.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Thirty-first Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Hopkins House</i>,     <br>
<span class="smcap">Morris, Illinois</span>,   <br>
<i>September Nineteenth</i>.</div>
<p>On calling for my bill at the Robertson House, Joliet,
in the morning, Mr. Conklin the proprietor, declined
to accept any pay for my accommodations, and
when I insisted, said he wished the pleasure of making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
me his guest during my stay. I did not get a very
early start, as a family by the name of Horner, upon
hearing of my arrival, called at the hotel and at their
solicitation I made them a short visit. They knew
of my journey and interest in the Custer Association,
and being patriotic made this their reason for wishing
to meet me. Their friendliness was but another proof
of the hospitality of the people of Joliet, among whom
I had come the day before as a comparative stranger,
but whom I left with the kindliest of feeling.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Mr. Conklin suggested that I ride
along the tow-path of the Michigan Canal from Joliet
to Chanahon, and I followed his advice, having dinner
at the latter place. It happened that the innkeeper
was well supplied with sweet cider and I helped
him to dispose of it by drinking the contents of six
well-filled glasses. Beyond Chanahon, on the Illinois
River, I borrowed a hook and line of a farmer who
was fishing and caught twenty-three perch in half an
hour.</p>
<p>At four o'clock I reached the summit of a hill on
the border of a prairie from which I could look off
for fifteen or twenty miles over a fertile country
through which two silver streams wound to unite just
below—the Kankakee here paying tribute to the Illinois.
The atmosphere was perfect—clear and pure;
the trees were tinged red and yellow with the first
frosts, and to all this was added the glory of the sunset
which I lingered to admire before turning away
from so charming a scene.</p>
<p>Such a view leaves a deep impress on the memory,
and stirs recollections of more youthful days. Emotions
like these have a purifying effect upon all men.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a></span></p>

<h4>One hundred and Thirty-second Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Clifton House</i>,    <br>
<span class="smcap">Ottawa, Illinois</span>, <br>
<i>September Twentieth</i>.</div>
<p>I rode out of Morris in the morning just as the public
school bells were ringing nine o'clock. My journey
now lay along the north bank of the Illinois River,
and took me through some of the finest cornfields I
had ever seen. Acres and acres, miles and miles
stretched in all directions as far as the eye could reach
whenever the elevation of the road was high enough
above this waving sea of grain to permit of my looking
about. Otherwise I passed through it completely
shut in, except as I could look ahead and behind
and see the avenue of giant stalks. My horse, sixteen
hands high, did not elevate me sufficiently to
enable me, sitting in the saddle, to look over the corn
tops, and they still towered above my head like so
many small trees.</p>
<p>Those who are privileged to see this agricultural
wonder must, however, associate it with that other
source of pride among Illinois farmers—the "hogs"—for
most of this splendid harvest is fed to these animals
and they, well-fattened thereby, are driven to
market. Thus the enterprising farmer is saved the
expense of hauling his corn to Chicago or other points,
as the pork, into which it has been transformed, is able
to carry itself.</p>
<p>All along my route across the "Sucker State," I
encountered, day after day, white hogs and black hogs,
hogs of every grade and shade, my horse often stepping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
aside in equine dignity to allow a drowsy or
pugnacious porker to pass.</p>
<p>As I had determined to reach Ottawa by nightfall,
I was compelled to ride nearly all day in a drizzling
rain which at noon was followed by a heavy thunder
shower. This I took advantage of by stopping at
Seneca for dinner, and then pushed forward. Was
forced to halt again at three o'clock on account of rain,
and being near a farm house was invited to "come in"
while the good people took care of my horse.</p>
<p>Overtook a troop of boys on horseback near Ottawa
and had their lively company into town. There I
met an old acquaintance—Mr. Kean—who was among
the first to greet me. My time was passed pleasantly
here, and I would do injustice to the proprietor of the
Clifton were I to forget the many courtesies politely
extended to me while his guest.</p>

<p>Left the Clifton House, Ottawa, at two <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> The
weather was still in an unsettled condition which
obliged me to make my way as best I could between
showers in order to keep my lecture appointment at La
Salle. I considered it fortunate that my route was
now along the west bank of the Illinois, a stream in
which I had long been interested owing to the important
part it played as a convenient and favorite water
course for the early explorers of the Valley of the Mississippi.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
Between its verdant banks, Joliet, Marquette,
La Salle and others glided on their way to the
great stream. How the lover of history and adventure
thrills at the accounts of La Salle's Fort Crève-Cœur,
and his colony scattered over this same region
of country!</p>
<p>Probably none of these historic men paid a more
flattering tribute to "La Rivière des Illinois" than
Hennepin, the priest, who, when passing down it to
the Mississippi was not too much oppressed with anxiety
to admire its charms. What a different appearance
its shores presented in 1680 to that of 1876! In
place of the forest, waving corn fields under high cultivation
attracted my attention on every hand, and in
contrast to the wilderness inhabited by the savages
whom Hennepin encountered, I saw an emigrant train
peaceably moving along on its way from the East to
the promising country west of the Mississippi.</p>

<i>September Twenty-second</i>.</div>
<p>The equinoctial storms were now at their height and
as my lecture at Davenport was not to be delivered for
some days, I decided to spend a day or two in this
pleasant little city, until "Old Sol" had "crossed the
line."</p>
<p>I found that this is the centre of important coal and
lead mines, which I should have visited and examined,
superficially at least, had not the inclement weather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
prevented. Through the courtesy of Colonel Stephens,
editor of the <i>La Salle County Press</i> and a colonel
in the volunteer service during the late war, I was introduced
to many of the citizens who told me much of
the history and enterprises of their town.</p>
<h4>One hundred and Thirty-fifth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Harrison House</i>,      <br>
<span class="smcap">La Salle, Illinois</span>,    <br>
<i>September Twenty-third</i>.</div>
<p>Rode down to Peru in the morning accompanied by
Colonel Stephens, who wished to show me the pride
of the county—the big plow works, which constitute
the leading industry of the place. Was introduced to
members of the firm and shown through the various
departments of the establishment, which were certainly
imposing in the way of machinery and in the evidence
of mechanical skill. We returned to La Salle at four
o'clock and my hospitable comrade proposed that we
take a stroll through the city, to which I quickly
consented.</p>
<p>Colonel Stephens introduced me to my audience in
the evening, and made pleasant reference to the brave
and chivalrous Custer. My entertainment here was most
gratifying and I was warmly assured of the good will
of the people through the local press.</p>
<p>I have proved that everywhere in this country the
spirit of hospitality reigns. Whether in large cities
or small towns, the utmost cordiality prevails, and the
stranger can always rely upon a hearty welcome.</p>

<h4>One Hundred and Thirty-sixth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Farm House</i>,          </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Near Hollowayville, Illinois</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>September Twenty-fourth</i>.    </div>
<p>Upon leaving La Salle at three o'clock in the afternoon,
I was told that I would have no difficulty in securing
accommodations for myself and horse at Hollowayville,
so, with the assurance of finding everything
lovely here, I jogged along over the intervening
twelve miles at my leisure.</p>
<p>My feelings can better be imagined than described
when, on my arrival at the little hamlet, I was looked
upon with suspicion. The simple-minded inhabitants
hinted that I might possibly be a "highwayman" or a
"horse thief," or, for aught they knew, one of the
James or Younger brothers. These desperadoes were
then exciting the people on both sides of the Mississippi
and my equipment, set off with high top boots
and gauntlets, with the peculiar trappings of my
horse, only made matters worse.</p>
<p>Finding it impossible to secure lodging in the village,
I rode on into the country, stopping at a farm
house which looked inviting. I entered the front yard
slowly and with dignity to dispel the horse thief suspicion.
The farmer's daughter, a young girl of seventeen
or eighteen years, and a few farm hands, stood
about, of whom I asked if the master of the place was
at home. The girl took me within, and Monsieur
and Madame Croisant received me. They were both
in bed, ill, but looking quite comfortable with their
heads pointing in different directions. They carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
on a lively conversation in French, the daughter interpreting,
and in conclusion, after assuring them that I
was a harmless person, very tired and hungry, they
decided, if the clergyman of the place thought it safe,
that I might stay with them. The dominie was called,
looked me over a few minutes, cross-questioned me,
and approved.</p>
<p>My room that night was unique in more ways than
one and would have been punishment enough for
Jesse James himself.</p>
<p>When I retired I detected a strong odor in the room
and found it due to a collection of <i>sabots</i>, or wooden
shoes, seemingly centuries old, which were arranged in
a row under my bed. What to do with them was a
question, as, under the circumstances, I did not think it
best to tamper with the feelings of my host and hostess.
As my room was on the ground floor, I decided
to place the <i>sabots</i> carefully outside under the window
and take them in in the morning before the family was
up. Unfortunately it rained and I overslept, so the
shoes were discovered full of water before I appeared.
However, nothing was said and I ate my breakfast
in peace, the good people probably thanking their
stars that they and their house had not been robbed.</p>
<p>Before leaving in the morning the <i>La Salle County
Press</i> was handed me by Miss Croisant, in which I
read the following flattering notice of my lecture in
that city and which in some measure compensated for
my unpleasant reception at Hollowayville:</p>
<blockquote><div><p>"We have not often met with a more agreeable and pleasant gentleman
than Captain Willard Glazier, who entertained a very respectable
number of our citizens at Opera Hall on Saturday evening by
delivering a lecture on 'Echoes from the Revolution.' The captain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>has a fine voice and his manner of delivery is decidedly interesting,
while his language is eloquent and fascinating. His description of
the battles of the Revolution, and the heroes who took part in them,
from the engagement on the little green at Lexington down to the
surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, was grand indeed, and was received
with frequent and enthusiastic applause. In conclusion he
referred in an eloquent and touching manner to the 'Boys in Blue,'
who took part in the late war for the Union, and all retired from the
hall feeling that the evening had been spent in an agreeable and
profitable manner.</p>
<p>"Captain Glazier served under Generals Kilpatrick and Custer
during the late war, since which time he has devoted much labor to
writing and is now making the attempt to cross the continent from
Boston to San Francisco on horseback, for the purpose of collecting
material for another work. He left Boston the early part of May,
and will endeavor to reach the Sacramento Valley before the fall of
the deep snow. His horse, <i>Paul Revere</i>, is a magnificent animal,
black as a raven, with the exception of four white feet. He was
bred in Kentucky of Black Hawk stock, has turned a mile in 2.33,
but owing to his inclination to run away on certain occasions, was
not considered a safe horse for the track. The captain, however, has
broken him to the saddle, and also convinced him that running away
is foolish business; consequently, he and the captain have become
fast friends, and with <i>Paul</i> for his only companion, the gallant cavalryman
proposes to cross the continent. Success attend him!"</p></div></blockquote>

<i>September Twenty-fifth</i>.</div>
<p>The equinoctial storms which had been raging since
I left Ottawa, were, for a few days at least, at an end,
and a bright autumn sun greeted me every morning
as I rode onward. Rich cornfields stretched away on
either side of the road, their monotony broken here
and there by fine apple and peach orchards just coming
into their glory. Another characteristic of Illinois—fine
stock farms—were also noticeable, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
for another stage of fourteen miles, surrounded by
evidences of fertility and thrift, I passed on, reaching
Wyanet early in the evening.</p>

<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Annawan, Illinois</span>,<br>
<i>September Twenty-sixth</i>.</div>
<p>Before leaving Wyanet I had <i>Paul's</i> bridle—a
Mexican make—repaired, and when it was again used
he chafed at the restraint of the curb. Not for long
though, for we were soon on the prairie, he evidently
enjoying it as much as his master. The roads were
rougher than usual and there was a change here in the
soil, its black clayey loam being very rich and productive,
making Henry County noted for its fine
farms. Eighteen miles of grass-covered prairie, diversified
by cultivated fields, brought me to Annawan,
where I was the guest of O. T. Buttermore, and while
at this place I received the following gratifying communication
from Colonel Stephens of La Salle—further
proof of the good will to "the stranger within
their gates," of the citizens of La Salle:</p>
<blockquote><div>

<p>I take pleasure in expressing to you on behalf of many of our
citizens, the gratification afforded our people who listened to your
instructive and entertaining lecture given at Opera Hall on Saturday

citizens, among them, W. A. Work, superintendent of our public
schools; A. J. O'Connor, clerk of the city court; W. T. Mason, Esq.,
and others, all of whom were present and heard your lecture, I was
requested to write you and tender their hearty thanks for the entertainment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>

<div class="signature1"><i>September Twenty-seventh</i>.</div>
<p>Started away from Annawan at nine o'clock but
after riding about a mile and a half I discovered that
I had left my journal and was obliged to return for it.
All day I was on a seemingly endless prairie, dotted
here and there with cornfields and apple orchards.
Illinois takes the lead in stock-raising, and the horses
and cattle seen in this day's ride were fully up to the
best standard.</p>
<p>Had dinner at the house of a coal miner, whom I
found very intelligent, and was well entertained by
a talk on mining industries in Illinois from a practical
point of view. This is a bituminous coal region
and there are mines in operation all over the State.</p>
<p>My host, Pullman by name, had recently returned
from the Pacific coast and to my eager inquiries was
able to tell me much about the country between
Omaha and Sacramento.</p>
<p>At night, after having made twenty-one miles, I
reached this place and was domiciled with the family
of Mrs. Charlotte Bills, who came formerly from Jefferson
County, New York. As my native county of
Saint Lawrence adjoins Jefferson, the Bills and I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
a lively talk on "Old York State," and I became
much interested in the work of this enterprising woman
and her family.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bills has succeeded in a direction which has
not generally been attempted by women; this is the
management of a farm. She does a good business and
supports herself and children by raising corn for
which, in this stock-raising locality, she finds a ready
market. The corn is generally bought for hog feed
and as these animals quickly fatten upon it, it is profitable.
The practical rather than the romantic has
place with these Western people who are striving for
a livelihood. Each day gave me new ideas of people
and their occupations—but this woman-farmer
was something unusual and certainly very praiseworthy.</p>

<p>Mounted my horse at eight o'clock and by easy
riding reached a farm house in Rock River Bottom,
where I passed the noon hour. After dinner I made
good time as the weather had changed and become
cold, reminding me of the necessity of hurrying on if
I would avoid the deep snows which the traveller is
sure to encounter in the elevated regions farther west
and it was every day more evident that I could not
well afford to allow my lecture appointments to conflict
with the dispatch of my journey.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a></span></p>

<p>On starting from Genesseo in the morning it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
my intention to make Moline the evening objective,
but I was compelled to halt at Milan—twenty miles
from the morning starting-point—where the bridge
was torn up that crossed Rock River at this point.
Being delayed, I sent a note forward to Davenport informing
Babcock that I would cross the Mississippi
the following afternoon at three o'clock; in the meantime
waiting, with what patience I could muster, for
the bridge work to proceed.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>FOUR DAYS AT DAVENPORT.</h3>
<p>I left the Milan House at two <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>,
<i>Paul</i> being eager for the start. Before
proceeding far I dismounted and ran
ahead leaving him to follow me if he
would. I ran over two or three small
hills and the faithful animal broke into a
gallop and was soon by my side mutely
inviting me to remount. About four
o'clock we crossed the Mississippi on the
fine Government Bridge which unites Rock Island and
Davenport, and proceeded to the Burtis House—since
named the Kimball. Colonel P. A. J. Russell was one
of the first to greet me. Moore's Hall having been
engaged for my lecture, I spoke at the usual hour
to a large audience, to whom General Sanders introduced
me. The local band in full uniform volunteered
their services for the occasion. The lecture was
a financial success.</p>
<p>The next three days were occupied in making my
acquaintance with the city. It is only fifty years ago
that the first cabin was erected here by white men. By
the side of the great river a bluff rises gradually to an
elevation of about one hundred and fifty feet, and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
its side and at its base the city of Davenport is built.
Over a bluff we come upon a beautiful rolling prairie,
and back as far as Duck Creek the land is covered
with fruit, vegetable and flower gardens, and presents
a picture of uncommon beauty. Views of the Mississippi
are obtained from the summit of the bluff; also
of Rock Island Arsenal and Rock Island City on the
opposite shore of the river.</p>
<p>In 1832, General Winfield Scott made a treaty
with the Indians of the Sac tribe for the purchase by
the United States of the land occupied by them bordering
on the west side of the river. The city of
Davenport was named after Colonel George Davenport,
the first white settler. Antoine Le Claire was
the first to own land in Davenport. His mother
was the daughter of a Pottawatomie chief and his
father a French Canadian. At this time the Northwest
territory was peopled entirely by Indians, with
here and there one of a different race fearless enough
to brave the dangers of a frontier life. Le Claire purchased
the claim upon which the city of Davenport
was laid out for one hundred and fifty dollars. In
1835, he sold it to a company who commenced the
building of the city. The first ferry between Davenport
and Rock Island dates from 1835. It was a flatboat
propelled by oars. At present a large steamboat
is constantly employed in transferring passengers and
freight between these cities. The river is about a
mile in width at this point.</p>
<p>Davenport excels all the other cities of the State in
the beauty and advantages of its location. The view
from the hill-tops is scarcely to be equalled for picturesqueness
by anything I saw during my journey.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
The city has made great and rapid progress in its
industries, wealth and population. The education of
the young is well provided for. It has a high school
built at a cost of $65,000. Griswold College—Episcopalian—occupies
a very picturesque site, overlooking
the river. The Catholic College is in a retired and
quiet spot, surrounded by beautifully shaded grounds,
the buildings being elegant and commodious. The
churches are numerous, every denomination being
represented. Grace Church, the protestant Cathedral,
is a fine substantial edifice, erected at a cost of
$80,000.</p>
<p>The Public Library on Brady street, founded by
Mrs. Clarissa Cook, a lady of wealth, is a highly prized
and flourishing institution. The Academy of Sciences
embraces a most valuable and unique collection of rare
curiosities, both ancient and modern, among others,
relics from the mounds of Iowa and adjoining States,
including skulls and skeletons of pre-historic man.</p>
<p>The population of Davenport is now about 20,000.
On account of its being built on a declivity the drainage
is perfect. It is surrounded by a most fertile country
and possesses every element for the growth of a large
city.</p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption49">THE ROAD TO THE CHURCH.</span>
</div>
<p>Recrossing the magnificent bridge spanning the river
between Davenport and the Illinois shores, I found
myself on Rock Island. The Island lies to the north
of the city, the latter not being located on the Island
but on the mainland of Illinois. Since 1804 the
Island proper has been the property of the United
States Government, although not occupied until 1812,
on the breaking out of the war with England. The
surface is very fertile, and coal and limestone are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
found in large quantities. It is about three miles
long, covering nine hundred and sixty acres. An
arsenal and armory are located here. A fort was
erected in 1816, and named Fort Armstrong. It
was garrisoned until May, 1836, when it was evacuated.
An ordnance depot was established by the
Government in 1840. In 1862, by Act of Congress,
the Island was made a United States Arsenal.
General Thomas J. Rodman was the first
appointed to the command and held the position
until his death. In 1869, Congress appropriated
$500,000 for a bridge across the Mississippi uniting
the Island with the city of Davenport. This fine
structure is a railroad and wagon bridge and affords
all necessary facilities for the movement of military
stores. General Rodman was succeeded in the command
of the Arsenal, in 1871, by Colonel D. W.
Flagler of the Ordnance Corps, and the Island has
become, under his management, the strongest military
post on the Mississippi. Substantial quarters for the
officers of the garrison and barracks for the soldiers,
have been erected, also a bridge connecting the Island
with the city of Moline.</p>
<p>Rock Island is connected with Rock Island City
on the Illinois shore and with Davenport on the
opposite side of the river, and also with Moline on
the east side about three miles above Rock Island.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1828, there were only nine white
men and their families on the site now occupied by
Rock Island City; the Indians of the Sac tribe were
much aggrieved by the whites taking possession of
their lands while the latter were away on their hunting
expeditions. Black Hawk, chief of the tribe, took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
great offence and protested strongly against it, and as
the number of white settlers increased the discontent
of the Indians grew stronger. They were urged by
the commanding officer of the Island and the Indian
agent, Colonel Davenport, to move across to the west
side of the river in compliance with their treaty with
the United States Government; but Black Hawk
refused to move and contended that the Island was
his property. The Fox tribe crossed the river and
established themselves there. The lands on the Illinois
side were now surveyed and sold to the settlers by
the Government, but Black Hawk and the Sacs still
refused to leave. Depredations were committed by the
Indians of which the whites complained, and in 1831
Black Hawk gave notice to the settlers to leave his
lands. Some neighboring tribes it was now feared,
would unite with the Sacs in an attack on the settlers,
who petitioned the military authorities and the Governor
of Illinois to protect them, and in this way what
is known as the Black Hawk War originated.</p>
<p>In response to the complaints of the settlers, Governor
Reynolds, of Illinois, called out sixteen hundred
mounted volunteers and marched them to the Island
and General Gaines at Saint Louis proceeded immediately
to the scene of action with the Sixth United States
Infantry. General Gaines ordered all the settlers to
move to the Island, and then invited Black Hawk to
talk over the situation. The military and settlers met
in the Council House, and Black Hawk, with about
one hundred warriors in their war paint, approached
and entered and soon commenced shouting in an
intimidating manner. It was thought that an attempt
at a general massacre would be made. An Indian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
called "The Prophet" raised his voice very high,
gesticulating and speaking rapidly in an angry tone
as if he desired to excite the warriors to an attack.
At length quiet was obtained and General Gaines
spoke to Black Hawk, reminding him of the sale of
the lands in dispute to the United States Government.
Black Hawk and his followers claimed that the lands
had never been sold. The treaty was then read and
explained to the chief, which seemed to enrage him
greatly. Black Hawk shouted: "The white people
speak from paper, but the Indian always speaks from
the heart." He further said that their lands had not
been sold, that the men who signed the treaty had no
authority to do so, or to sell their land. And even if it
was sold, they were not paid for it. The General said
that the Government had assigned him and his people
land on the west side of the Mississippi. His only
answer was that he would neither leave nor fight and
if the whites attempted to drive him off, he would sit
down in his wigwam and they might do what they
liked with him. General Gaines understood by this
that he would defend what he considered his rights.</p>
<p>Preparations for an attack were now made by the
commanding officers and Governor Reynolds, and on
June 19, 1831, troops were assembled near the mouth
of Rock River. The next morning they moved
upon the Indian village. Black Hawk, however, and
all his people had left in the night, crossed the Mississippi
and were camped a few miles below Rock
Island. Ten days after, the chief presented himself on
the Island with twenty-seven warriors and voluntarily
signed a treaty of peace with General Gaines and the
Governor of Illinois, the latter representing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
National Government. The terms of this treaty included
a pledge on the part of Black Hawk not to
return to the east side of the river or give any more
trouble to the white settlers.</p>
<p>In the following winter, Black Hawk refused to
keep the treaty any longer and in April, 1832, he and
about five hundred of his braves crossed the Mississippi
at Burlington and moved up the east bank of the river
with his women and children, intending to drive out
the settlers and return to their old village on the
Island. The Winnebagoes and other Indians were to
have assisted him in recovering the land. This news
soon reached Saint Louis and Colonel Atkinson with
a body of infantry left that city for Rock Island.
Zachary Taylor, afterwards President of the United
States, was in command of a company, and Lieutenant
Jefferson Davis, afterwards President of the Confederate
States, was attached to the same regiment throughout
this campaign.</p>
<p>About two thousand volunteers were brought forward
by Governor Reynolds of Illinois, assembling
at Beardstown and marching to Yellow Banks, fifty
miles below Rock Island. They moved to the mouth
of Rock River where they were joined by Colonel
Atkinson and his regulars. The volunteers were
under the command of General Whiteside, and Abraham
Lincoln, afterwards President of the United
States, served under him as captain of a company.
The Indians had ascended Rock River and halted
opposite Rock Island, the women and children having
been sent higher up the river in canoes. Black Hawk
now made an attempt to capture Fort Armstrong.
He crossed to the Island with his warriors in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
night, but a violent storm arising interfered with his
plans that night, and in the morning Colonel Atkinson's
Infantry arrived and drove them from the Island.
They followed their women up Rock River, pursued
by Colonel Atkinson and the volunteers under General
Whiteside.</p>
<p>Nearly the whole of Black Hawk's band was destroyed
in the following months of May, June, July
and August, and Black Hawk himself was captured
and removed as a prisoner to the Island. He and his
son Seoskuk, and other chiefs, were afterwards taken
to Washington and other eastern cities. On his
return from his eastern tour, Black Hawk settled
down with a remnant of his own tribe on Des Moines
River, where he died in 1838.</p>
<p>The Sacs and Foxes are believed to have originally
come from the vicinity of Montreal, Canada, about the
year 1700, and had lived on or near, Rock Island over
one hundred and thirty years. After the close of the
"Black Hawk War" there were no hostilities with
the Indians at Rock Island.</p>
<p>During the late Civil War the Island was converted
into a military prison and upwards of 12,000 Confederate
prisoners were confined here. About 2,000
died and were buried on the Island.</p>
<p>A pleasant day may be passed in wandering over
the Island, which is now an important United States
Arsenal for the Mississippi Valley.</p>
<p>Rock Island City is situated on the mainland on
the Illinois bank of the river. East of the city,
stretching away to Rock River, are some picturesque
bluffs and scenery of great beauty. On the sides of the
hills are many comfortable residences of well-to-do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
citizens. The city is about midway between Saint
Louis and Saint Paul, and immediately opposite the
larger city of Davenport, Iowa. The iron bridge
owned by the United States Government and connecting
the two cities is open to the public free of toll.</p>
<p>The water power produced by the rapids has largely
contributed to the growth of Rock Island City, and
also of Moline—a city of factories—within an easy
walk of its neighbor. In the latter I found many establishments
for the manufacture of plows, cultivators
and other farming appliances; also wagons and carriages,
together with foundries and machine shops.</p>
<p>Rock Island City has a commerce and trade second
to no city of its size in the Union. The centre of a
system of railroads, the city has a busy aspect at all
times. The population at the time of my visit was
about 16,000.</p>
<p>Three miles from Rock Island City, inland, is a resort
frequented by the residents of both sides of the
river. Its traditions and associations are romantic.
It is known as <i>Black Hawk's Watch Tower</i>. The
<i>tower</i> consists of a rock and is the summit of the
highest hill, overlooking Rock River and affording an
extensive picture of the surrounding country. The
rock derives its name from its having been used by
Black Hawk as a point from which he could survey
his lands for many miles. Tradition says it was selected
by the chief's father and overlooked the tribe's
first village on the banks of Rock River. Black
Hawk gave the following account of the place to
Antoine Le Claire in 1833: "The tower was my
favorite resort and was often visited by me alone,
where I could sit and smoke my pipe and look with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
wonder and pleasure at the grand scenes that were
presented, even across the mighty river. On one occasion
a Frenchman who had been resting in our
village, brought his violin with him to the Tower to
play and dance for the amusement of my people who
had assembled there, and while dancing with his back
to the cliff, accidentally fell over it and was killed.
The Indians say that at the same time of the year soft
strains of the violin can be heard near the spot." He
further relates that in the year 1827, a young Sioux
Indian, who was lost in a violent snow-storm, found
his way into a camp of the Sacs, and while there, fell
in love with a beautiful maiden. On leaving for his
own country he promised to return in the summer and
claim his bride. He did so, secreting himself in the
woods until he met the object of his affection. A
heavy thunder-storm was coming on at the time, and
the lovers took shelter under a rocky cliff on the south
side of the Tower. Soon a loud peal of thunder was
heard; the cliff was rent into a thousand pieces and
they were buried beneath them. "This, their unexpected
tomb," says Black Hawk, "still remains undisturbed."</p>
<p>In the spring, summer and autumn many hundreds
of visitors climb to the Tower, especially on Sunday and
holidays, and while breathing the pure, healthful atmosphere,
enjoy delightful views of the surrounding
country and the majestic river at their feet. The
Davenport family own the property, which, however,
is accessible to all visitors.</p>

<h3>DAVENPORT TO DES MOINES.</h3>
<h4>One Hundred and Forty-fifth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature1"><i>Farm House</i>,  </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Near Blue Grass, Iowa</span>,</div>
<div class="signature1"><i>October 3, 1876</i>.</div>
<p>Weather cold, but clear and bracing.
Mounted <i>Paul</i> at three o'clock P. M.
and halted at the office of <i>The Democrat</i>,
to say good-bye to Colonel Russell. On
the road I overtook S. N. Garlock, a
farmer, who invited me to spend the
night at his house, which I agreed to do
and was made very comfortable. I soon
discovered that Mr. Garlock was a
native of the Empire State, but came to Iowa twenty-seven
years ago, and was now the owner of a prosperous
farm near the village of Blue Grass. He spoke
of visiting his old home in the East and his intention
to proceed by way of Philadelphia and spend a day or
two at the Centennial Exposition. He said that many
Western people were making arrangements to go to
the "Exposition" and at the same time visit their old
homes and the old folks whom they had not seen for
many long years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>
<h4>One Hundred and Forty-sixth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Iowa House</i>,    </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Moscow, Iowa</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>October Fourth</i>.</div>
<p>Moscow is a small agricultural hamlet twenty-nine
miles west of Davenport, with a population of less
than three hundred, but increasing in number as the
surrounding region is occupied. On the road here
from Blue Grass I found the weather becoming very
cold and was compelled to dismount several times and
walk some heat into my body. The country is rich in
fertility of soil—generally rolling prairie. The villages
along the road are said to be growing very rapidly.</p>
<h4>One Hundred an Forty-seventh Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>St. James Hotel</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Iowa City, Iowa</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>October Fifth</i>.  </div>
<p>Reached here at six o'clock P. M., fifty-five miles
from Davenport. Weather, most of the day, cold,
cloudy and generally disagreeable. I learn upon inquiry
that the land about here for miles is, for the
most part, settled by a thrifty, intelligent and enterprising
people, and is well adapted to all the wants of
the agriculturist. The railroad brings all the produce
into market and farmers and manufacturers have their
labors rewarded. The soil is a rich, black loam, and
often, I am told, from five to ten feet in depth.</p>
<p>Had supper and retired to my room to attend to
my correspondence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>
<h4>One hundred and forty-eighth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>St. James Hotel</i>,<br>
<span class="smcap">Iowa City, Iowa</span>,<br>
<i>October Sixth</i>.  </div>
<p>The weather continued extremely cold. Babcock
completed necessary arrangements with the proprietor
of Ham's Hall for my lecture the following evening.
In the meantime I took a look at the city which
was for many years the State capital. Its most salient
feature appeared to be the State University, in
which both sexes continue their education with commendable
zeal, under competent professors. There are
also a high school, a female college, a commercial
college and several common schools. Four or five daily
and weekly newspapers keep up the interest of the people
in local affairs and national politics; and four banks
encourage the thrifty to place their spare cash with
them at interest. Woollen and flax manufactures give
employment to a considerable number of young people,
and the mills are said to be in a flourishing condition.</p>
<p>The city has a large internal trade as well as with
the several surrounding villages.</p>
<h4>One hundred and forty-ninth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>St. James Hotel</i>,<br>
<span class="smcap">Iowa City, Iowa</span>,<br>
<i>October Seventh</i>.</div>
<p>The former State House is a fine and capacious
building and an ornament to the city. On the removal
of the seat of government to Des Moines, one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
hundred and twenty miles farther west, the building
with its extensive grounds was granted by the Legislature
to the State University.</p>
<p>I also noted several large places of business here,
including dry goods, groceries and hardware. There
are several lumber yards, flouring mills, plow factories,
iron foundries, for manufacturing machinery; also
due proportion to the population.</p>
<p>The newspapers published here are, according to all
accounts, ably conducted and well sustained. The
surrounding country is well adapted to all the wants of
the agriculturist and is thickly settled.</p>
<p>In the evening I delivered my promised lecture to a
very full house—Hon. G. B. Edmunds introducing
me to the audience. The walls were covered with
flags and a profusion of flowers greeted me on my arrival
on the platform.</p>
<h4>One hundred and fiftieth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Tiffin House</i>,<br>
<span class="smcap">Tiffin, Iowa</span>,<br>
<i>October Eighth</i>.</div>
<p>Mounted <i>Paul</i> in front of the Saint James to continue
my journey and felt the need of an overcoat.
Drew rein at Tiffin, a few miles from Iowa City. Of
Tiffin little more can be said than that it has a rustic
population of about fifty souls. The accommodations at
the Tiffin House I must leave to conjecture, as any description
would fall short of the reality. The only
guests were a Methodist parson, two farmers on an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
expedition in quest of apples, and an overland tourist.
The nabob of the village came into the public room in
the course of the evening—a farmer and former State
senator. This "Hon." gentleman engrossed our attention
for about three hours by a long-winded description
of the varieties of the "genus hog"—how to breed,
how to feed and fatten, and how to drive him to market;
all of which would probably have been edifying
and elevating to the average Tiffinite, but it made me
and the parson drowsy and I retired to dream of hogs
and fat bacon until awakened by the daylight.</p>
<h4>One hundred and fifty-first Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Grand Pacific Hotel</i>,<br>
<span class="smcap">Marengo, Iowa</span>,  <br>
<i>October Ninth</i>.    </div>
<p>In my journey from Tiffin I found it necessary to
dismount several times and walk in order to drive
away the sensation of cold. Reached Marengo in the
evening and registered at the Grand Pacific Hotel.
Winter seemed to be approaching with rapid strides at
this time and I was warned that it was necessary to lose
as little time as possible at the different resting-points.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption50">
<img alt="AN IOWA VILLAGE." height="261" src="images/illus-419.png" title="AN IOWA VILLAGE." width="450" id="id-2427936661438839476">
<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption50">AN IOWA VILLAGE.</span>
</div>
<p>Marengo is eighty-five miles from Davenport.
There is a good bridge crossing the Iowa River here,
which adds much to the facilities for doing business.
A thriving community of farmers occupy the surrounding
land. Among the most important villages
and towns in this and adjoining counties, are Newton,
Grinnell, Montezuma and Millersburg, all growing in
size and importance. Marengo is the county-seat of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
Iowa County, and contains a population of nearly two
thousand.</p>
<p>The State of Iowa, taken as a whole, is one of the
most fertile in the United States. The native prairies
are fields almost ready-made for the farmers' hands;
their rich black soil returning him reward for his labor
a hundred fold.</p>
<h4>One hundred and fifty-second Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Skinner House</i>,  <br>
<span class="smcap">Brooklyn, Iowa</span>,<br>
<i>October Tenth</i>.  </div>
<p>My ride to-day from Marengo has been over fine
prairie land with occasionally a farm in the distance
like an oasis in the desert. Brooklyn is one hundred
miles from Davenport and, as some evidence of its
prosperous condition, has four hotels. I was fortunate
in selecting the Skinner House, the proprietor of which
knows how to make his guests comfortable. <i>Paul</i>
also seemed happy to-night when I shut him in a
clean and well-appointed stable with his supper.</p>
<p>Brooklyn is a village of over twelve hundred inhabitants,
and wears the impress of success. There
are several grain elevators, foundries, flour mills and
business houses of all kinds; also graded schools, banks,
and daily and weekly papers. The streets are clean and
well paved, which is more than can be said for its
Eastern namesake. The surrounding farms are large
and well cultivated, and the country presents a most
attractive appearance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>
<h4>One hundred and fifty-third Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Moore House</i>,  <br>
<span class="smcap">Kellogg, Iowa</span>,<br>
<i>October Eleventh</i>.</div>
<p>In front of the Skinner House, <i>Paul</i> caused me
some little anxiety by dashing up the street from the
front where I had left him with loose rein for a moment
while settling my bill. Coming back he gave
me to understand, by a toss of his head, that he only
wanted to shake a little dust from his feet. I was soon
mounted and off at a gallop, covering thirty miles,
when I stopped at a farm house for dinner.</p>
<p>On reaching the outskirts of Grinnell, I hailed a
party of boys who were "playing <i>ball</i>." One bright
little fellow gave me the time, two o'clock, and the distance
to Kellogg. I then pushed on without stopping
at Grinnell. Amused myself with some little boys in
front of a country school house who were "playing
<i>horse</i>." I inquired of the youngest if he went to
school, and his brother answered for him in the affirmative.
I then asked, "What does he learn?" "He
don't learn nothin'," answered the youth. "Then why
do you take him to school?" I inquired. "So, when
the boys go out, he can 'play <i>horse</i>' with us."</p>
<p>Have seen some of the finest scenery and grandest
farms to-day that I have encountered along my journey.
The day has been unusually bright and pleasant, and
the country looks lovely in the extreme. Reached
Kellogg to-night, half an hour after dark. Caught a
young snipe about a mile from the village and offered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
it to a young girl if she could name its species. She
could not, and a boy claimed the prize.</p>
<p>Amused some of the guests in the evening with incidents
of my journey, and they, in turn, gave me some
useful information about the Far West, North Platte,
Green River, and Humboldt Valley.</p>
<h4>One hundred and fifty-fourth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Pacific Hotel</i>,<br>
<span class="smcap">Colfax, Iowa</span>,<br>
<i>October Twelfth</i>.</div>
<p>Arrived at Colfax in the evening after a glorious
ride over the prairie. The grain on the farms waved
in the breeze as the fields were passed and numerous
streams crossed finding their way to the rivers that intersect
the State. This prairie is not entirely devoid
of timber, for groves dot the extended landscape like
islands in a green sea; while from the higher grounds
I viewed the prairie decked with wild hay and autumn
flowers.</p>
<div class="poem">
<span class="i4">—"Broad on either hand</span><br>
<span class="i0">The golden wheat-fields glimmered in the sun,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And the tall maize its yellow tassels spun."</span>
</div>
<p>The prairie here is from twenty to forty miles in
width. A variety of minerals are found and mined to
a limited extent. Time will work many changes.
A quarter of a century hence, Colfax will probably
be known as an important mining town with large
and varied interests. Its growth will be gladly noted
by many who have faith in its future.</p>

<h4>One Hundred and Fifty-fifth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Jones House</i>,      </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Des Moines, Iowa</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>October Thirteenth</i>.</div>
<p>Mounted <i>Paul</i> at eight o'clock and rode twenty miles,
which brought me to Des Moines. Most of the
journey was over prairie land; the sun shone brightly
and afforded me an agreeable warmth as <i>Paul</i> stepped
out bravely—cheered, possibly by the prospect of entering
a large city and resting for a day or two. We
know nothing of a horse's prevision. The country
along my route is rich in fertility of soil, but its
resources are not yet fully developed. I am told that
but little snow falls on this prairie, the winter being
made up of cool, sunshiny days, and clear, frosty
nights. There is nothing, I think, to hinder this part
of Iowa from being one of the most healthy portions
of the United States.</p>
<h4>One Hundred and Fifty-sixth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Jones House</i>,      </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Des Moines, Iowa</span>,</div>
<div class="signature"><i>October Fourteenth</i>.</div>
<p>I have not seen a brighter or more stirring city in
my line of march than Des Moines, the capital of the
State of Iowa. Under the escort of Professor E. T.
Bowen, city editor of <i>The Leader</i>, and two other well
informed gentlemen, I visited the Iowa State Perpetual
Exposition and was introduced to the secretary, who
courteously showed me over the buildings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>
<p>The city stands at the mouth of the Raccoon River,
is three hundred and fifty-eight miles west of Chicago
and one hundred and forty-two east of Omaha. Its
shape is quadrilateral—four miles long by two miles
wide. The Des Moines River flows through its centre,
dividing the East from the West Side. The city
stands on a declivity, its highest part extending to
about one hundred and sixty feet. The Post Office,
Court House and city offices, the principal depots and
hotels, and the greater portion of the business houses,
are situated on a plateau about a mile long and half a
mile wide, rising about fifteen feet above high water;
and on the higher ground beyond are some of the
handsomest and largest private residences.</p>
<p>On the East Side is another business locality. Capitol
Square contains ten acres on an elevated site commanding
a fine view. The State House was erected
at a cost of nearly $3,000,000. The Public Library
contains some 30,000 volumes. There are over twenty
churches of all denominations in the city. The Post
Office and Court House buildings are of marble and
cost $250,000. There is also a State Arsenal, a large
County Court House and many public improvements
found only in first-class modern cities. Two daily and
upwards of a dozen weekly papers are published here.
In the vicinity are mines of excellent coal and a number
of manufactories of various kinds are in operation.</p>
<p>Before leaving the Jones House it is but just that I
should say that I was not more courteously treated
during my journey than by Messrs. George W. Jones
and Son. Professor Bowen and Captain Conrad with
many others saw me off.</p>
<p>The next day a copy of the Des Moines <i>Leader</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
reached me, in which the following notice appeared.
I insert it here as one of many pleasant references to
my journey.</p>
<blockquote><div><p>"Captain Willard Glazier, the horseback traveller across the Continent,
took in the Exposition on Saturday evening with intense
gratification. He says he has seen no place on his route from Boston
more promising than Des Moines. Among the calls he received at
the Jones House was one from Captain Conrad, a prominent attorney
from Missouri and now settled in his profession in this city, who was
a fellow-captive with Captain Glazier in Libby Prison during the
Rebellion. The Captain continued his journey westward yesterday
with the best wishes of the friends he has made during his short stay
here."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a></span></p></div></blockquote>

<h4>One Hundred and Fifty-seventh Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Byers House</i>,    </div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Adel, Iowa</span>,    </div>
<div class="signature"><i>October 15, 1876</i>.</div>
<p>Left Des Moines with pleasant thoughts
of the cordial reception I had met with,
and pursuing my way westward over the
prairies, reached this village in the evening
after a twenty-five miles' ride over a
section of the country strikingly beautiful.
The soil of the prairie, I am everywhere
informed, is almost invariably of
the most productive character. No other
State, in short, has finer facilities for growing all the
cereals of the temperate zone than Iowa.</p>
<p>Adel is the county-seat of Dallas County, situated on
the Raccoon River—generally called the "Coon." At
the period of my visit the village had a population of
less than one thousand, and although agriculture is
the leading industry, considerable attention is given
to manufacturing. The prairie land in the vicinity
was, as yet, sparsely settled, but every inducement was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
offered settlers to establish themselves here. I noticed
some broken fields, and blue smoke curling up from
farm houses in the distance; and after eighteen miles
of enjoyable exercise in the pure prairie atmosphere,
reached this small village, where I concluded to halt
for the night.</p>
<h4>One Hundred and Fifty-eight Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Private House</i>,  <br>
<span class="smcap">Dale City, Iowa</span>,<br>
<i>October Sixteenth</i>.</div>
<p>Weather warmer, pleasant and more invigorating
than during the past few days. Left Adel at eight
o'clock A. M., and passed through Redfield at eleven,
still on the great prairie which appears to have no
limit. From the hill-tops the valleys wear the aspect
of cultivated meadows and rich pastures; and on the
level spreads the wild prairie, decked with flowers, its
long waves stretching away till sky and prairie mingle
in the distance. Twenty years ago the red men chased
the elk and buffalo where now are prairie farms and
prairie homes. As I advance, I meet occasionally
with trees skirting the streams that find their way to
the rivers that intersect this beautiful State.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a></span></p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption52">A NIGHT AMONG COYOTES.</span>
</div>
<p>Had dinner at a prairie farm house and talked politics
with the farmer, whom I found was an enthusiastic
admirer of Peter Cooper. He did not expect his
political favorite would be elected, but as a matter of
principle would vote for him. I told him if he called
himself a Republican, he should cast his vote for Governor
Hayes, but my advice probably had little effect
upon him. Reached Dale City about one o'clock. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
was a small village in Lyon County, with about two
hundred inhabitants.</p>
<h4>One Hundred and Fifty-ninth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature2"><i>A Night with Coyotes</i>,</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Between Dale City and Anita, Iowa</span>,</div>
<div class="signature2"><i>October Seventeenth</i>.</div>
<p>My journey to-day led me again over the seemingly
endless prairie—extending beyond the range of human
vision. Halted at a farm house for dinner, near Dalmanutha,
an agricultural settlement in Guthrie County.
Wishing to reach Anita before stopping for the night, I
continued on the road after dark, contrary to my usual
practice.</p>
<p>For some time before sunset I had not seen a farm
house or even a tree as far as the eye could reach,
and now could see nothing of road or trail. Accordingly
I gave <i>Paul</i> the rein and left him to pick
his way. He followed a sort of blind road which led
to a haystack. I thought I could do no better than
make my bed on the sweet hay, and decided to spend
the night there supperless. I had scarcely settled myself
when a troop of coyotes, or prairie wolves, came
howling and barking in front of me. This made
things uncomfortable, and I at once jumped to my feet
and, revolver in hand, faced the enemy. Several
were killed by my fire. The remainder, however,
continued to threaten an attack. I was puzzled as to
what was best to do when I was suddenly re-inforced
by a friendly dog, who, attracted doubtless, by the report
of the pistol and the barking of the coyotes, came to my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
rescue, and kept the animals at bay for the remainder
of the night. At daybreak I was not sorry to bid
adieu to the haystack and, neither, I believe, was <i>Paul</i>,
who had also spent a restless night, notwithstanding
the abundance of good fodder at his disposal.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that the coyote seems to partake
of the nature of the dog and the wolf. In the
winter, when food is scarce, these animals will attack
man, but, unlike the wolf, if a bold resistance is
offered, they will speedily decamp. A pack of coyotes,
however, are not pleasant company on a dark
night.</p>
<h4>One Hundred and Sixtieth Day.</h4>
<div class="signature"><i>Pacific Hotel</i>,   <br>
<span class="smcap">Atlantic, Iowa</span>,<br>
<i>October Eighteenth</i>.</div>
<p>Was again all day on the prairie inhaling the pure,
invigorating air as <i>Paul</i> and I faced a stiff breeze
from the Northwest; and at four o'clock arrived at
Atlantic, a thriving village of over three thousand
inhabitants, dependent, like all the villages I had
passed, upon the surrounding farms. These farms are
mostly in a flourishing condition, are fenced and under
good cultivation, divided into meadows and fields of
every variety of grain. The village is delightfully situated.
As an evidence of its prosperity it supported
two ably conducted daily papers and three weeklies,
three banks and several graded schools. I was now
eighty-two miles from Des Moines. The prairie here
is gently undulating and the soil composed of vegetable
mould and sand. Atlantic, I infer from its busy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
appearance, has a destiny above that which it has
attained.</p>

<p>Weather cloudy, threatening rain as I rode out of
Atlantic in the morning at ten o'clock. Covered twenty
miles and stopped for dinner at another farm, near
Walnut. On my road saw a man at work in a large
cornfield and, hailing him, inquired the distance to
Avoca. After a few words had passed between us, I
was surprised and pleased to discover that he was from
my native county—St. Lawrence, New York, and
knew many of my old friends and acquaintances in
that quarter. Our conversation turned upon old
localities and associations, much to our mutual enjoyment.
The days of our youth were recalled, and
although we had never met before, we parted after
half an hour's chat as if we had been friends of many
years' standing. My friend expressed perfect satisfaction
with his rustic life on the prairie and was quite
enthusiastic over the prospects of his farming operations.
The soil he said was excellent, easy to cultivate
and, in fact, second to none in the State.</p>
<p>Avoca is a purely agricultural village with a population
of about 1,500, all, more or less, interested in
the big farms within a radius of one to two miles of
the busy town. Two weekly newspapers kept the
citizens <i>en rapport</i> with the outside world and the hustling
life of the large cities.</p>

<span class="smcap">Neola, Iowa</span>,    <br>
<i>October Twentieth</i>.</div>
<p>A drizzling rain on leaving Avoca made the prospect
of my ride to this point somewhat gloomy. Over
the interminable prairie again my journey lay, as it
had done ever since I entered the State of Iowa, but a
more magnificent sight I never saw than presented
itself before me this afternoon on reaching the summit
of an extensive table-land between Avoca and Minden.</p>
<p>Halted a few minutes for lunch at Minden, and met
a gentleman there who had attended my lecture at
Detroit, upon which he was pleased to compliment me.
Neola is a small prairie settlement of about three
hundred inhabitants and is surrounded by several good
farms. Of the Neola House I can only say that I
shall not easily forget it and its proprietor—especially
the nocturnal serenade of all the cats of Neola—which
deprived me of sleep throughout the night; and the
extremely scant accommodations provided for the guests.</p>
<p>The soil here is inferior in quality to that of no
other section of the State. The land is well watered
and was gradually filling up with an industrious class
of citizens.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a></span></p>

<p>Left Neola at eight o'clock and reached Council

the city, in bad condition, but the splendid country
through which I had passed since entering the State
was perhaps equal to anything ever trodden by the feet of
man. The surface of Western Iowa is very different
from that of the prairie region in the eastern part of
the State, being rougher and more hilly. The numerous
streams proceeding from springs bursting from the
hillsides, are clear and swift. Near the Missouri River,
high and precipitous mountain bluffs are ranged, and
the region contiguous is very hilly. The highest hills
are covered with verdure—grass and timber. The soil
generally is light and to appearance poor, but is loose
and sandy, and found to be easily cultivated. Creeks
and smaller streams of water occur frequently and
afford power for mills and machinery, and furnish
abundant supply for farming uses and stock.</p>
<p>The first white settlement in Western Iowa was
made in the year 1847, by a company of Mormons or
Latter-Day Saints, who had been exiled from Illinois
in poverty and destitution. They passed through a
part of the country then only inhabited by savages.
They planted small colonies at places on the route, the
main body pushing on to the bluffs near the Missouri
River. A considerable number, unable to go farther,
remained here, commenced clearing the land for farming,
and two years later, in 1849, began the building
of a town on the site now occupied by the city of
Council Bluffs. Their new town they named Kanesville
after one of their leaders. Several stores were
built and opened, and the population was soon largely
increased by people who were not Mormons and had
no sympathy with them. The new settlers being
greatly in the majority, virtually drove out the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
"Saints," who finally left in a body to join their people
at Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>Council Bluffs is now the most populous and flourishing
city of Western Iowa. At the time of my visit,
the inhabitants numbered only about 8,000, but it was
then growing rapidly and bid fair to become one of
the big cities of America. There is a large trade
here employing an immense capital. The most important
manufactures are the iron works and machine
shops, the agricultural works, carriage factories, steam
plows, and mills of various kinds, the city has ample
railroad communication by means of several lines converging
here. Omaha, on the opposite bank of the
Missouri, is only four miles distant. The fine, substantial
bridge connecting the two cities is 2,750 feet
in length and has eleven spans. It has a railroad track,
and accommodation for horse-cars and ordinary travel.</p>
<p>The most important public buildings are the County
Court House, City Hall, High School building and
the ward school houses. There were three banks
and two daily and three weekly newspapers. The
Catholics have a seminary for young ladies and a boys'
parochial school. The State Institute for the Deaf and
Dumb is near the city.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a></span></p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h3>A HALT AT OMAHA.</h3>
<p>Omaha, the capital of Douglas County,
the chief commercial city and metropolis
of Nebraska, is the half-way station across
the Continent. It is aptly called the
"Gate City," seeming, as it does, a sort
of opening to the great railroads, the
great waterways, and the whole fascinating
great beyond of western enterprise
and western commerce.</p>
<p>As I rode into the city it seemed that it would be
hard to find a more attractive place.</p>
<p>"A fine plateau nearly a mile broad, and elevated
fifty or sixty feet above the Missouri, is occupied by
the chief business portion of the city," while the beautiful
bluffs, the low, rounded, tree-covered hills, forming
a semi-circle on the west and south, are thickly
dotted with tasteful and elegant residences and buildings
surrounded by carefully laid-out grounds.</p>
<p>The streets cross at right angles. Most of them
are one hundred feet broad; but Capitol avenue is
one hundred and twenty feet in width.</p>
<p>On high grounds, just southwest of the city limits, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
Hanscom Park, a fine, natural grove, beautified by art
for the delight of pleasure seekers.</p>
<p>Conspicuous on the west is the extensive Poor
House Farm, containing the fine brick poor house.</p>
<p>To the north, on a high wooded hill, solitary, apart
from the city, yet always within sight of its bustle
and rush, lies, in its solemnity, Prospect Cemetery.</p>
<p>In the northern section of the city, also, we find the
Douglas County Fair Grounds, the Omaha Driving
Park, and Fort Omaha.</p>
<p>A bridge, the erection of which cost $1,500,000,
spans the Missouri and connects Omaha with Council
Bluffs.</p>
<p>I found Omaha not only fair to look upon, but also
interesting in many ways. It is the key to the Rocky
Mountains and the gold mines of California. Its
wholesale trade amounts to about $15,000,000 annually
and is constantly increasing. Its industries
include smelting, brewing, distilling, brick making,
machine and engine building and meat packing. The
trade in the latter branch being only excelled by that
of Chicago and Kansas City.</p>
<p>Its manufactures are constantly increasing. The
Union Pacific Machine Shops alone employ about seven
hundred men. Omaha has a linseed oil mill which
turns out yearly millions of oil cakes and thousands
of gallons of oil. One of the city's distilleries is so
extensive that it pays the United States Government
a tax of $300,000 per year.</p>
<p>The educational advantages of this metropolis are
unsurpassed by any city of its size in the West. It has
eleven fine ward school buildings and one high school.
The latter occupies the former site of the old territorial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
capitol. It is a fine, large building, erected in
1872, at a cost of $250,000. Its spire is three
hundred and ninety feet above the Missouri River, and
its cupola commands a view embracing many miles of
river scenery.</p>
<p>Creighton College is a Jesuit institution, endowed
by Mrs. Edward Creighton to the amount of about
$155,000. It will accommodate four hundred and
eighty pupils and opens its hospitable doors to all
students, irrespective of creed or race.</p>
<p>A four-story stone Post Office stands on the corner
of Dodge and Fifteenth streets. That building, together
with the furniture which it contains, is alleged
to have cost $450,000; and Omaha people claim that
it is one of the handsomest government buildings in
all the land.</p>
<p>By the way, self-respect, humble pride, an appreciation,
a love and admiration of every good thing the
"Gate City" contains, is a characteristic of all honest,
true-hearted Omaha men—God bless them! They are
even proud of their jail, which is universally conceded
to be the handsomest and strongest penal institution
in the West.</p>
<p>Omaha is headquarters for a military division
known as the Department of the Platte. A great part
of the financial supremacy of the city is due to the
heavy purchase and distribution of military supplies.
The General Government, some time since, acquired
eighty-two and a half acres of land, two miles north
of Omaha, christened it Fort Omaha, and spent over
$1,000,000 in erecting military buildings upon it.</p>
<p>Statistics change rapidly in this Gate to progress and
improvement. In the year 1877, improvements were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
added to the city amounting to about $800,000; in
1878, amounting to $1,000,000, and in 1879, to about
$1,222,000.</p>
<p>Such was the Omaha which I rode into. How
thought-compelling a place it was! How typical of
the push, vigor, enterprise and pluck which have
proved so masterful in the development of our once
"Wild West." It is with pleasure that the mind runs
over its history.</p>
<p>The first knowledge we have of the region in which
Omaha is situated, comes to us, like many another
crumb of information, from Father Marquette. He
visited that tract in 1673, explored it and mapped
out the principal streams. At that time the region
was claimed by Spain, and formed a part of the great
Province of Louisiana. It finally became a French
possession, and was sold by that nation to the United
States in the year 1800, for $1,500,000.</p>
<p>On the twenty-seventh of July, 1804, Messrs. Lewis
and Clark came up the Missouri, and camped on the
Omaha plateau, where the waters of the river then
covered what is now the foot of Farnam street, and
that part of the city where the Union Pacific Machine
Shops are now located, also the smelting works, warehouses,
distillery, extensive coal and lumber yards,
and where numerous railroad tracks form a suggestive
network.</p>
<p>In 1825, T. B. Roye established an Indian trading
station on the present site of the city.</p>
<p>In 1845, a band of Mormons, driven from Illinois,
settled slightly north of the Omaha of to-day. They
came as "strangers and pilgrims," and called their
little settlement by the suggestive title of "Winter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
Quarters." The Indians, however, insisted that the
Mormons should not remain. So pressed, the saints
divided their little party. A few families, under the
leadership of Elder Kane, crossed the Missouri and
started a settlement destined to become Council Bluffs.</p>
<p>The balance of the inhabitants of "Winter Quarters"
placed themselves under the leadership of
Brigham Young, and with one hundred and eight
wagons migrated to Utah, where they immediately
staked out Salt Lake City, and began to build their
Temple.</p>
<p>By so slight a circumstance Omaha missed being
next door neighbor to, or even becoming herself, the
New Jerusalem of the Saints.</p>
<p>William D. Brown is conceded to have been the first
white settler who staked out a claim on the plateau
now occupied by Omaha. He started for the California
gold fields. On his way it occurred to him how
profitable it would be to establish a ferry across the
Missouri to accommodate the thousands passing westward.
Putting in practice his idea, in 1852, he
equipped a flatboat for that purpose. He named this
venture of his "Lone Tree Ferry," from one solitary
tree on the landing, just east of where in Omaha to-day
stand the Union Pacific Shops.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1853, Mr. Brown staked out a
claim embracing most of the original town site of
Omaha.</p>
<p>July 23, 1853, Brown became a member of the
Council Bluffs and Nebraska Ferry Company, whose
object was to open a steam ferry, and to establish
a town on the west bank of the river. Despite
protests from Indians and without consent of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
United States, in the winter and early spring of 1854,
what is now Douglas County was nearly covered by
staked-out claims of "sooners" and speculators.</p>
<p>May 23, 1854, Nebraska was admitted into the
Union as a Territory, and in the same year Douglas
County was created. Immediately, upon a beautiful
plateau, a town site was selected, laid out, and christened
Omaha.</p>
<p>The first house in Omaha was commenced before
Omaha itself legally existed. It was built by Thomas
Allen. It was a log house, was named the St. Nicholas,
was used as a hotel, a store, or anything else
which the public demanded.</p>
<p>In July of the same year another house was built—this
one being of pine flooring. It was on the present
site of Creighton College. Here, a few weeks after its
erection, the first native Omaha boy first saw the light,
and from this same house, a few days later, an Omaha
citizen first passed out to that mysterious country</p>
<div class="center">"From whence no traveller returns."</div>
<p>The third house was called "Big 6." Its owner
opened "A general assortment of merchandise suitable
for time and place," and "Big 6" soon became a
place of note.</p>
<p>House No. 4 was opened by a house warming,
which was attended even by settlers from the adjacent
State of Illinois.</p>
<p>In the same year, that of 1854, the so-called Old
State House was built by the Ferry Company to accommodate
the first territorial legislature. It was not
an architectural beauty, and consequently, in 1857, it
gave place to a large, brick Capitol.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a></span></p>

<p>In this, to Omaha, memorable year of 1854, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
first doctor, the first lawyer and the first minister
settled in her boundaries, also the first steam mill began
running.</p>
<p>January 15, 1855, the large frame Douglas House
was opened by a grand ball. It did an immense business
for many years, and became notedly the headquarters
for politicians and speculators.</p>
<p>The first territorial legislature convened January
16, 1855, and remained in session until March seventeenth
of the same year. Where that legislature should
meet became a question of vital importance to a number
of Nebraska towns. The matter was hotly contested
but the metropolis won the prize, acting Governor
Cummings designating Omaha as the favored spot.</p>
<p>Traffic by steamboat did much to develop the "Gate
City." Sometimes boats arrived seven or eight times a
week, bringing new inhabitants, timber, machinery,
provisions, furniture, and piling their cargo—human
or inanimate—out upon the since washed away levees,
to be taken care of as best the embryo city could.</p>
<p>The first boat of the season was the event of the
year. Down the inhabitants ran to meet it, without
regard to age, sex or race; down they trooped,
laughing, shouting, rejoicing that communication with
the great world was once more open. Many a "cotillon"
was danced on the deck of that first boat, while
the unloading was being vigorously carried on below.</p>
<p>There was little crime in the new city. In the
three formative years only one murder is known to
have been committed, and no criminal was legally
executed until 1863.</p>
<p>There was never much Indian trouble in this vicinity.
However, Omaha several times raised troops to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
protect the whites of Douglas County. In 1864, a
large band of Indians appeared on the Elkhorn and
so frightened the settlers that they poured into Omaha
before daylight. Business was suspended, a meeting
called in the Court House at two o'clock <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, and
before sunset every able-bodied man was armed. This
promptness and efficiency so impressed the Indians
that no outbreak took place.</p>
<p>In the late Civil War, Omaha responded nobly to
the call of the General Government. The First Regiment
of Nebraska Volunteers, the First Battalion, the
Second Regiment Nebraska Volunteers, the First Nebraska
Veteran Cavalry, and four companies of Curtis'
Horse, came almost entirely from Omaha.</p>
<p>The first telegraph line reached Omaha in 1860.</p>
<p>The first breaking of ground for the Union Pacific
Rail Road took place in Omaha, December 3, 1863.</p>
<p>The first train from the East reached Omaha by
the Chicago and Northwestern route, January 17,
1867.</p>
<p>So Omaha grew and prospered. It took about
twenty-seven years to bring it out of original wildness
to the state of excellency in which I found it as I
passed through on my horseback journey. Yet it
seems but yesterday since no human dwelling occupied
the place now covered by our young city. Here
the Indian council-fires burned; on the bluffs, with
no more civilized weapon than his bow and arrow,
he hunted deer, buffalo, elk, bear and wolf. Here
his war-whoop rang out clear and unmolested. Here
brave, free, unfearing, he dwelt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a></span></p>
<div class="center">"Monarch of all he surveyed."</div>

</div>
<p>And now he is completely effaced from this region.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
Gone and only remembered by some quaint name still
attached to stream or mountain.</p>
<p>To-day "the moving millions, both in this country
and Europe, are making earnest inquiry for Nebraska."
50,000 new inhabitants came to it in 1880.
The close of the late war brought many ex-soldiers
and their families here to claim land privileges near
Omaha, and from "the four quarters of the globe the
swelling thousands have come to settle with those that
made their way thither. From Maine and Texas, and
from every territory of the Rocky Mountains, they
came." "The rank and file, the bone and muscle,
were men who came to stay, who counted the cost,
who measured the sacrifice." Under their faithful
hands the desert has been made to "blossom like the
rose." "The dug-out and the log house have given
place to the elegant mansion, and thousands of groves
have sprung up almost as if by magic all over the
prairies."</p>
<p>These brave pioneers knew it would be so. They
believed in the embryo city. By faith they saw the
fields blossoming for the harvest. They heard the
song of harvest home, they saw the smoke of the rising
city, the highways of commerce, and some of them
saw the highways of nations, so long a fable to the
American people, stretching up through their valleys
to the everlasting mountains and on to the broad
Pacific. To-day the day-dream of these brave men is
realized—</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>OMAHA TO CHEYENNE.</h3>
<p>As winter was approaching and the days
were now becoming considerably shorter,
it was incumbent upon me to hasten my
departure from Omaha, if I would
reach my destination as contemplated at
the outset. Having learned from frontiersmen
that Eastern horses are not
available in the Alkali Region of the
Plains, I placed my faithful <i>Paul</i> in a
boarding stable in Omaha, purchased a mustang of a
Pawnee Indian and forthwith continued my journey
westward.</p>
<p>Webster defines a <i>mustang</i> as the "Wild Horse
of the Prairie." My experience with him has taught
me that he is sufficiently docile under the restraint
of a tight rein; will travel a longer distance over a
rough road in a given time than the average horse,
and scarcely ever shows fatigue even if the road is
all up-hill. Of course, some of them are vicious,
and will make things uncomfortable for the rider;
but in this particular some civilized horses are not
unlike them. I found the Mexican saddle more convenient
than the "McClellan" which I had hitherto
used, and thought much easier for the animal.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption57">
<img alt="NORTH PLATTE, NEBRASKA." height="252" src="images/illus-457.png" title="NORTH PLATTE, NEBRASKA." width="450" id="id-5537774717214874778">
<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption57">NORTH PLATTE, NEBRASKA.</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>
<p>My mustang proved tractable and made excellent
time; and having obtained in Omaha all the information
within my reach concerning the remaining half
of my journey, I determined to use all despatch and
avoid as far as I could the cold weather of the Rockies
and Sierras.</p>
<p>I may here state that in consequence of the long
rides I was now compelled to make, with very few
stoppages except at night, the original plan of the
journey was somewhat changed, and my journal necessarily
fell into disuse; my chief object being to get
over the mountains as quickly as possible. I was,
therefore, unable during the remainder of my ride to
refer so much to daily incidents, but confined myself
to jotting down in a general way whatever I thought
might prove of interest to the reader.</p>
<p>Over the Great Plains that lie between the Missouri
and the Rockies my nerve was thoroughly
tested, and not less so the mettle of my mustang which
carried me a distance of five hundred and twenty-two
miles in six days. Halts at this time were few and far
between, except for necessary food and sleep. The
weather had become very cold since leaving Omaha,
and the ascent had been gradual but continuous.</p>
<p>The surface of Nebraska is extremely varied. There
are no elevations that can be dignified with the name
of mountains, but in its northern and western parts
there are lofty hills. Along the Niobrara and White
Rivers, extending into Dakota, there are sand-hills
with a very scanty vegetation and very difficult to traverse
on account of the loose sand. The gently rolling
lands of three-fourths of Nebraska appear very much
like the suddenly petrified waves and billows of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
ocean. Minerals had not yet been found to any considerable
extent, and the scarcity of coal rendered more
valuable the extensive beds of peat found in some parts
of the State. The <i>salt</i> basins of Nebraska are rich and
extensive. The principal one is located in Lancaster
County, covering an area of twelve by twenty-five
miles. Fossil remains, of great interest to geologists,
have been discovered in great quantities. Indian hieroglyphics,
which ante-date the traditions of all living
tribes, are cut deep in the bluffs along the Missouri
River, in places now inaccessible.</p>
<p>The Platte or Nebraska River, from which the Territory
received its name, is a broad and shallow stream.
It is claimed that there is not a foot of land in Eastern
Nebraska that is not susceptible of cultivation. High
winds sweep over the plains, and the storms are sometimes
of terrible severity. The climate is dry and
exhilarating, and the nights generally cool throughout
the summer. There is no part of the United States
better adapted for stock-raising than the prairies of
Nebraska.</p>
<p>There is a well-equipped university at Lincoln, a
normal school for the training of teachers and an institution
for the blind at Nebraska City.</p>
<p>After a fifty miles' ride from Omaha a halt was made
at the Sherman House, Fremont, Dodge County, for
supper and lodging. The journey had been pleasant
and the landscape charming in its quiet beauty. The
south wind was neither too warm nor too cold for perfect
comfort, and my mustang looked as if he could
carry me another fifty miles without any inconvenience
to himself.</p>
<p>Fremont had a population of nearly 3,000, and has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
a large trade in grain, cotton and lumber. It has a
court house, a high school, three banks and four newspapers.</p>
<p>Left early the following morning and at night slept
in a wigwam with Pawnee Indians, in the absence of
other shelter, and they gave me of their best. At
Lone Tree, a post office in Nance County, I stopped
at the Lone Tree House for the night, and next morning
at dawn, the weather being very fine, hurried forward
on my journey. Reached Grand Island, where
I was accommodated at a private house with bed and
board.</p>
<p>Grand Island is in the Great Platte Valley on
Platte River, one hundred and fifty-four miles west of
Omaha. It stands 1,800 feet above sea level. The
Island, on which the town is built, is fifty miles long.</p>
<p>Wood River, my next resting-place, is a township
in Hall County with a population not exceeding one
thousand. On the following day good headway was
made, but I could find no better accommodation for
the night than at a Pawnee camp. On the succeeding
night, after a hard day's ride, I stopped
at Plum Creek, two hundred and thirty miles west of
Omaha, and was accommodated at the Plum Creek
House. A bridge spans the Platte River at this point.
The population was only three hundred, but a weekly
paper had been started and was well supported. The
next evening, the McPherson House, McPherson,
received me and my mustang and treated us hospitably.
Then followed North Platte, one hundred and thirty-seven
miles from Grand Island, where I lodged for the
night at a private house, the home of a pioneer. The
repair shops of the Union Pacific Railroad were located<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
here; also a bank and two enterprising newspapers.
The population of the township was nearly three thousand.
At Sidney, which is a military post, I stopped
at the Railroad Hotel. Sheep-farming is a leading
industry of Sidney and its vicinity. My last stopping-place
in Nebraska was at Evans Ranche, Antelope, a
small village on the Elk Horn River.</p>
<p>Crossing the boundary into Wyoming Territory and
reaching Cheyenne, I made my entrance into this most
interesting region—a great plateau of nearly 100,000
square miles, its lowest level 3,543 feet, its highest altitude
more than 13,000 feet above the sea. Some one
has said that it seems "a highway, laid out by the
'Great Intelligence,' in the latitude most favorable, at
all seasons, for great migrations to the shores of the
Pacific."</p>
<p>Shales bearing petroleum, iron, limestone, soda, sulphur,
mica, copper, lead, silver and gold, are all there
for the taking.</p>
<p>There, volcanoes are still at work.</p>
<p>There, great mountains, great canyons, and great
cataracts make the face of Nature sublime.</p>
<p>There, in past centuries, "at some period anterior
to the history of existing aboriginal races," lived a
mysterious, to us unknown people, traces of whom we
still find in neatly finished stratite vessels, "knives,
scrapers, and sinkers for fish lines made of volcanic
sandstone or of green-veined marble. Such is the
tract of territory called Wyoming."<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption58">
<img alt="PLUM CREEK, NEBRASKA." height="252" src="images/illus-463.png" title="PLUM CREEK, NEBRASKA." width="450" id="id-7502188064994976478">
<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption58">PLUM CREEK, NEBRASKA.</span>
</div>
<p>Beginning at the southeast corner of this tract, we
encounter, not far from the boundary, a semi-circular
range, about 2,000 feet above the general level,
known as Laramie Hills. The north branch of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
Platte, coming from the south, sweeps in a long
curve about it; and just at the base of this Laramie
range nestles the so-called "Magic City," Cheyenne,
the capital of Wyoming.</p>
<p>White men first explored this region in 1743, and in
1744, when Sieur de la Verendrye and his sons came
down from Canada, lured by the then unexplored
Rocky Mountains. But the region was fearfully
wild. Not only was the face of Nature most strange,
but the whole tract was overrun by belligerent
savages.</p>
<p>In 1804 a few brave white men began hunting
beaver there. But it was many long years before
civilization took possession of the spot. Not indeed
until mining was begun on the summit of the Rocky
Mountains in Dakota.</p>
<p>Then the fact of railroad construction brought great
crowds to the North Platte country, crowds composed
of two diametrically opposed elements, namely workers
and loafers. These two elements joined hands for
once, strange as it may seem, and together they settled
Cheyenne. They located it near several military posts,
and just as close to Denver as they could get it, and
still keep it in Wyoming. At Denver was a bank.
They wanted to be near that institution, and so came
within one hundred and six miles of it. Such were a
settler's ideas of propinquity!</p>
<p>Several items contributed to making this young
settlement a success. The most important of these
items was that, in 1867, the Union Pacific Railroad
Company began to locate its shops there. That was
rarely fine bait for mechanics. The coal and iron
mines in the suburbs proved good bait for miners.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>
<p>So, from these humble beginnings, Cheyenne came
into existence, awoke, bestirred herself, became fired
with ambition, and made the summer of 1867 one
never to be forgotten in her boundaries.</p>
<p>On July first of that year, the agent of the Union
Pacific Railroad erected in Cheyenne the first structure
belonging to that company.</p>
<p>In August, the city government was formed, H. M.
Hook being chosen mayor.</p>
<p>On September nineteenth, the first issue of the
Cheyenne <i>Evening Leader</i> was published.</p>
<p>September twenty-seventh, a meeting was held for
the purpose of organizing a county to be called Laramie.</p>
<p>On October eighth, an election was held to vote for
a representative to Congress, to elect county officers,
and to locate the county-seat. It was decided that
every citizen of the United States, who had been in
the territory ten days, might vote. One thousand nine
hundred votes were cast, and Cheyenne was declared
the county-seat.</p>
<p>On October twenty-fifth, telegraphic communication
with the East was opened.</p>
<p>November thirteenth, the first passenger train came
through from Omaha, and one month later the track
was laid to Fort Russell.</p>
<p>About July first of that year, a Mr. Post bought
two lots in Cheyenne for six hundred dollars. He
then went to Denver on business, stopped to stake out
his claim in a coal mine, and returned to find that city
real estate had become so inflated in his absence that
he was enabled to sell a fractional part of his six hundred
dollar lots for five thousand six hundred dollars.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>
<p>About July first, the Union Pacific Railroad sold
lots for one hundred and fifty dollars per lot. A
month later, they were worth one thousand dollars
apiece, increasing in price at the rate of one thousand
dollars per lot each month for some time after.</p>
<p>On July 1, 1867, Cheyenne was simply a little corner
of the wilderness.</p>
<p>On January 1, 1868, it was a city of six thousand
inhabitants.</p>
<p>Was it not indeed a "Magic City," which could
furnish a six months' record like the above?</p>
<p>However, this was but the <i>Quatre Bras</i> before the
Waterloo.</p>
<p>Cheyenne's real struggle for life, for advancement,
for culture and permanent prosperity, was to begin
with this new year of 1868. We know how grandly
the young city conquered, not by "magic" this time,
but better still, by patience, pluck, and indomitable
will. But to her honest and law-abiding citizens, at
the outset of 1868, things looked dark indeed.</p>
<p>Cheyenne was the terminus of the Union Pacific
Railroad that winter, and the scum of the floating
Western population drifted thither.</p>
<p>Houses were insufficient, and many wintered in
tents and dugouts.</p>
<p>To make things worse, great numbers of squatters
came, and began seizing town lots.</p>
<p>"Shootings were frequent, and every manner of vice
abounded. A canvas saloon would answer as well as
another for gambling, drinking, and the purposes of
the dives. Various men and women made the place
intolerable. It was never disputed that this town exceeded
in vice and unwholesome excitement any of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
new cities of the West." The police were overwhelmed.
Crime, theft, and assault were rampant. Patience
ceased to be a virtue.</p>
<p>The commander at Fort Russell was appealed to,
and a battalion was sent by him to escort the squatters
beyond the city limits.</p>
<p>After that, the good people of Cheyenne took matters
into their own hands, deciding to</p>
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Take up arms against a sea of troubles,</span><br>
<span class="i0">  And by opposing, end them."</span>
</div>
<p>A vigilance committee, that <i>dernier</i> resort of the
order-loving Westerner of that period, was formed.</p>
<p>On January 11, 1868, this committee arrested three
men for robbery. The criminals were bound together
and placarded with the following notice:</p>
<blockquote><div><p>"$900 stole. $500 returned! Thieves F. St. Clair, W. Grier, E.
D. Brownell! City authorities please not interfere until ten o'clock
A.M. Next case goes up a tree! Beware of Vigilance Committee!"</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Comparatively gentle measures, like the above, were
useless. Authority in that wild land had to be made
of "sterner stuff." Not until the vigilants had hung
and shot a dozen men did comparative order prevail.
There was many a dark day for the well-wishers of
Cheyenne; yet they lost</p>
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"No jot of heart or hope,</span><br>
<span class="i0">  But pressed right boldly on,"</span>
</div>
<p>and gradually peace came out of strife, order out of
confusion, and civilization reigned supreme.</p>
<p>In 1869, Cheyenne became the great <i>entrée</i> port of
the vast regions north and west.</p>
<p>On September seventh of that year the first term of
court was held in the city.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a></span></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>
<p>In that same month of September, an election for
members of the first Territorial Legislature took place.</p>
<p>That Legislature held a sixty days' session. Some of
its <i>dicta</i> were as follows:</p>
<p>Gambling was allowed.</p>
<p>Taxes were placed upon all property, real or personal,
excepting only United-States and public property;
and in cases of individuals, exempting clothing
and furniture, amounting to one hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Jails were to be placed in every county.</p>
<p>And, "last but not least," Cheyenne was declared
the seat of the territorial government, and an appropriation
was asked for with which to build a capitol.</p>
<p>Surroundings change rapidly in the rush of a new
community, and 1870 saw Cheyenne established,
strengthened, purified, settled.</p>
<p>The floating riff-raff had passed away, leaving a
solid, intelligent population of sixteen hundred.</p>
<p>The city had at that time one public school and two
private ones; the latter containing about sixty pupils.
It had five well built and well furnished churches.
The orders of Masons, Knights Templar, Odd Fellows,
and Good Templars were all represented in Cheyenne
at that time. The city had two large banks, three tobacconists,
three hardware houses, two shoe stores, one
confectionery, two bakeries, one livery stable, two first-class
hotels, many common ones, a daily newspaper,
two weeklies, a well organized fire department, and
"an acqueduct, nearly completed, for bringing water
from a source seven miles away into the city."</p>
<p>Cheyenne was now well governed, orderly, at peace,
and only three years old.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>
<p>She has not stood still—the brave little "Magic
City!"</p>
<p>She keeps on growing, becoming more beautiful,
more prosperous. The best we can wish for her is
that her future may prove as phenomenal and brilliant
as her past has been.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h3>CAPTURED BY INDIANS.</h3>
<p>Cheyenne was at length left behind,
and, with the object of securing companionship
in my journey across Wyoming
and Utah, I made the acquaintance
of two herders—rough men and plain
of speech, but apparently reliable and
trustworthy. During the few days spent
with these pioneers of the Plains, I
learned but little of their past lives, yet
I was thoroughly satisfied from the first that they
would prove invaluable guides in my otherwise lonely
ride over the Rockies.</p>
<p>My new companions, Israel Gordon and a Mexican
with unpronounceable name, were on their way to Salt
Lake City with a few mustangs and Indian ponies,
and we at once arranged to journey together as far as
our respective routes carried us.</p>
<p>On our first day out from Cheyenne we were much
favored, having a clear sky and a southwest wind,
which tempered pleasantly the usual chilliness of the
season. A ride of thirty-three miles on an up-hill
road brought us to Sherman, the highest point touched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
in the Rocky Mountains by the Union Pacific Railway.
Here we halted for the night, had supper, and
slept under our blankets in the open air.</p>
<p>After a light breakfast the following morning,
November first, we continued our journey along the
line of the Union Pacific. Still favored with fine
weather and our mustangs being in excellent condition,
good progress was noted in the march westward. I
had now become quite well acquainted with my new-made
friends, and, as our ponies shook the dust of
many miles from their feet, we talked of the strange
region through which we were passing, and of the routes
which led to objective points beyond the mountains.
During these conversations I learned that Gordon was
born in Vermont, and lived in that State until the
close of the Civil War, when he emigrated to Nebraska,
and later to Wyoming, where for several years he led
a wandering life among the hunters and cow-boys of
the Far West. My other companion told me that he
began life in New Mexico, and at the age of twenty-one
drifted into Colorado, from which Territory he migrated
to Cheyenne, in 1867. Both men were robust,
strong of limb, and thoroughly accustomed to the
habits and practices of the mixed population of the
Plains.</p>
<p>As the reader may have observed, I have undertaken
from the outset in this chapter to give some
idea of the life and habits of my fellow-travelers, for,
as will be discovered on another page, they were destined
to share with me the most trying ordeal of my
journey from Ocean to Ocean.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption61">

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption61">CAPTURED BY INDIANS.</span>
</div>
<p>On reaching a point about a mile east of Skull Rocks,
on the Laramie Plains, we were surprised to find ourselves
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>confronted by a band of Indians—thirteen in
number. This caused no uneasiness at first, as Indians
are often seen on these Plains. We soon discovered,
however, that they were on no friendly errand, and,
upon a nearer approach, the herders pronounced them
a raiding party of Arrapahoes. They were evidently
in pursuit of plunder, were decked in war-paint, and
as soon as we came in range of their rifles sounded the
war-whoop and bore down upon us, in a manner that
betokened anything but a peaceful visit, and left no
doubt in our minds as to the motive of their attack.</p>
<p>The Arrapahoes were at this time the friends and
allies of the Sioux, and the chief objects of their raid
were doubtless revenge for white men and horses
for their warriors, who were then rendezvoused in the
Black Hills.</p>
<p>Fully convinced that we were in the presence of an
enemy determined to kill or capture our little party,
no attempt was made to parley. The ponies were
hurriedly drawn together so as to form a barrier against
the assaults of the Indians, who were now in short
range and gradually closing in upon us. As they
galloped around us, the Indians formed a circle and
kept up an incessant fire, to which we replied over the
backs of our ponies, but with little effect, as from their
mode of attack they were a constantly shifting target
and difficult to reach, even with the best weapons in
use. My own equipment consisted of a carbine, such
as I had used in the cavalry service during the Civil
War, and a 22-calibre Colt's revolver. Gordon and
the Mexican were each provided with a Winchester
rifle and navy revolver, while nearly all the Arrapahoes
were armed with Winchesters and revolvers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a></span></p>
<p>But few moments were required to settle the unequal
contest. Four of our horses fell in rapid succession,
including my own mustang; in the meantime
we brought down one Indian and three ponies. The
Indian was instantly killed by a shot from the Mexican.</p>
<p>On seeing one of their number fall, the Arrapahoes
rushed upon us with deafening yells, and with such
force as to render resistance useless. Our arms were
taken from us, our horses quickly seized, and, in much
less time than it takes to tell it, we were mounted
and riding at a rapid pace to the northward, under a
guard of six well-armed Indians, who were carefully
instructed as to their duties by their chief, Lone Wolf.
The remainder of the band were more or less occupied
in scouring the country for horses and other plunder,
wanted for their encampment in the Black Hills.</p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption62">
<img alt="DECIDING THE FATE OF THE CAPTIVES." height="263" src="images/illus-481.png" title="DECIDING THE FATE OF THE CAPTIVES." width="450" id="id-3615988832657501242">
<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption62">DECIDING THE FATE OF THE CAPTIVES.</span>
</div>
<p>We rode at a trot or gallop until about ten o'clock
at night, when a halt was ordered by the chief, and
all dismounted; a fire was built and some antelope
meat, secured during the day, was partially roasted
and distributed among the Indians and their captives.
We were for some time squatted around a big fire—our
captors engaged in earnest conversation. Gordon
understood enough of their language to interpret that
the discussion related to their prisoners—that the
friends of the Indian killed at Skull Rocks, and who
were in the majority, were in favor of putting all of
their prisoners to death for having shot one of their
number. Lone Wolf, however, interposed, saying it
would be enough to take the life of him who had
killed their brother. Supper over, four Arrapahoes
approached us and seized the herder who had fired the
fatal shot. They led him to a stake which had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
driven in the ground about fifty yards from the bivouac;
to this stake he was firmly bound by lariat
ropes. All of the Indians then began dancing around
and torturing their victim in the most brutal manner
conceivable. Arrow-heads were heated in the fire and
held against his naked person. Three or four of the
Indians made a target of their captive, and amused
themselves by hurling at him their sharp-pointed
knives, which, penetrating his body, remained imbedded
in the flesh, until he was nearly exhausted with pain
and loss of blood. These tortures were continued
until our unfortunate comrade lost consciousness, when
one of the Arrapahoes, more humane than his associates,
advanced and ended his sufferings by a pistol-shot
in the head.</p>
<p>In the meantime Gordon and I were seated on the
ground, bound together, and unable to offer any relief
to our suffering companion, who bore his tortures with
a greater degree of composure and fortitude than I
ever witnessed on the battle-field or within the walls
of the dungeon, and, while no stately column or monumental
pile marks his resting-place, he deserves to sleep
beside the heroic martyrs of the border who have
risked life and suffered privation and hardship for the
advancement of a higher civilization.</p>
<p>Having disposed of the Mexican, several of the
Indians now approached Gordon and myself, and,
separating us, seized me roughly by the arms, and,
dragging me to the stake, bound me to it and commenced
a series of dances, accompanied by much gesticulation
and taunting, which they doubtless intended as
a sort of introduction to tortures which were to follow.
Lone Wolf, who had from the first seemed friendly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
but who was at this time some distance from the camp-fire,
now rushed to my rescue and dispersed our inhuman
captors, who were loath to desist from their
devilish work. A few minutes later a brother of the
Indian killed at Skull Rocks removed the scalp of the
Mexican, and, after he had fastened it to his belt, all
began dancing around the fire, singing and shouting
until they were thoroughly exhausted, when they
squatted upon the ground, apparently regretting that
they had not been permitted to put more trophies in
their scalp locks.</p>
<p>An object of interest to us at this time was the
horses which were tethered by long lariat ropes to
stakes which had been driven in the ground at a convenient
distance from the encampment. Could we but
elude the guard and mount the mustangs we were
riding when captured, our chances for escape would be
all we could wish. As usual, we were bound together,
with two stalwart Indians in charge. The other
Indians disposed themselves around the fire and slept.
I and my companion slept very little, but pretended
to do so. We were always on the alert and seeking
opportunities to escape. About two o'clock in the
morning our guards were relieved by two others, and
all was again quiet around their camp-fire. At the
first streak of dawn, the Indians were up and had a
scant breakfast of dried buffalo meat and venison,
which had been secured from the ranches of frontiersmen
during their raid of the previous day; of this
they gave us barely enough to satisfy hunger.</p>
<p>As soon as all were ready for the trail, Gordon and
I were each given a pony, which we mounted under
the close scrutiny of the guard, and the entire party<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
started northward at a brisk trot. No real attempt to
escape had thus far been made and the watch became
somewhat relaxed, the attention of the Indians being
devoted chiefly to foraging. When opportunity seemed
favorable for the capture of horses or cattle, a halt
was called by the leader, and three or four of the
party were detailed for this purpose. These foragers
were expected to keep themselves and their prisoners
supplied with meat and such other rations as could be
found in the straggling cabins of frontiersmen, but, as
their raids often proved fruitless, we were, at best,
scantily provided for, and many times entirely without
food.</p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption63">ESCAPE FROM THE ARRAPAHOES.</span>
</div>
<p>We were now skirting the Black Hills, and I had
discovered by this time that our captors were making
their way to the Arrapahoe rendezvous, about one hundred
miles from Deadwood.</p>
<p>At the end of the second day the routine of the
previous night was repeated: the Indians built a fire,
cooked and ate some antelope meat, which had been
brought in by the foragers during the afternoon, and
then lay down around the fire for the night, their two
prisoners being again bound together, with a guard on
each side. Notwithstanding these precautions, however,
on the part of the Arrapahoes, I was quietly on
the alert, and, although feigning sleep, was wide awake
and prepared to take advantage of any circumstance
which might prove favorable to an escape. I passed
the fingers of my right hand over the cord that bound
the left to my fellow-prisoner and felt sure that with
patience and persistence the knot could be untied and
our liberty regained.</p>
<p>While the guards dozed and slept, as on the previous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
night, our eyes steadily sought the arms and
ponies. We were quite certain that any attempt to
escape, if detected and defeated, would result in immediate
torture and death; but were, nevertheless,
firmly determined to make the effort, let the consequences
be what they might, for by this time we were
thoroughly convinced that, if taken to their encampment
in the Black Hills, the Indians would be most
likely to detain us as hostages for a long period, and
in the end possibly, should the inclination seize them,
subject us to brutalities that only savages can devise.
With such reflections and but indifferent opportunity
to put our plans for escape to the test, we passed our
second night in captivity.</p>
<p>At dawn of the third day, November second, after
the usual breakfast of antelope, Lone Wolf called his
band together and, mounting, continued his march
northward, halting occasionally for rest and refreshment.
About eight in the evening all dismounted
and bivouacked for the night. The weather was now
extremely cold in this high altitude, and was keenly
felt by the Arrapahoes and their white captives.</p>
<p>Shivering with cold and without blankets, Gordon
and I, still bound together at the wrists, lay down to
sleep with our captors around a smouldering fire.
The Indians sought sleep—their prisoners thought
only of possibilities for escape.</p>
<p>With the experience I had gained in Southern
prisons during the Civil War and the herder's thorough
knowledge of the Plains, I felt confident that we could
make our escape if we were constantly on the alert for
the opportune moment. During the early hours of
the night we had each fixed our eyes upon a pony.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
These animals were grazing near the camp-fire, with
their saddles on, ready for immediate use if required.
Under the pretence of being asleep we began snoring
loudly, and the guards, feeling at ease concerning their
prisoners, slept at intervals, although restless until
midnight, when we found them sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>I now worked at the cord which bound me to my
white companion and ascertained that I could untie it.
While making the attempt one of the Indians moved
in his sleep and I ceased my efforts for the moment,
and all was quiet again. The opportunity arrived at
length, the knot was loosened, and the noose slipped
over our hands, which gave us liberty. We quickly
took possession of two revolvers, but the guards, being
awakened by our movements, were about getting on
their feet, when we dealt them stunning blows with
the butt of the revolvers, forced them to the ground,
and gained needed time for our escape. Each rushed
for a pony, leaped into the saddle, and, before Lone
Wolf and his band had shaken off their slumber, we
were urging our mustangs to their utmost speed southward.</p>
<p>But a moment elapsed before all of the Indians
were mounted and in pursuit of their escaping captives;
but this had the effect only of spurring us to
still greater speed. Finding several of our pursuers
in short range I turned in my saddle and sent a
bullet among them; another and another followed.
One Indian fell from his horse, but the darkness prevented
our seeing if the other shots had told. The
Arrapahoes returned the fire, but luckily without any
worse result than increasing the pace of our flying
ponies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>
<p>Away we tore over hill-top and through canyon
until but three or four Indians could be seen in pursuit,
when Gordon, saying it would be much better for
both to take separate routes, at once dashed off through
a ravine to the right. One Indian considerably in advance
of his companions was at this time closing upon
me, but I sent a bullet into his horse, which put a temporary
stop to pursuit and would have enabled me to
distance my pursuers in the saddle had not my own
horse fallen an instant later through a well-directed
shot from the Indian I had just dismounted.</p>
<p>I now dropped into a gulch, remaining hidden until
morning. With the coming light I found the coast
clear, and, emerging from my place of concealment,
set out in a southwesterly direction, which brought me
to a cattle ranche late in the afternoon, grateful, indeed,
for liberty regained and for the freedom which enabled
me to continue my journey toward the shores of
the Pacific. After listening to my story the generous
ranchmen whom I here met supplied me with food and
a fresh mustang. Again facing westward I pursued
my course over the Rockies, striking the Old Government
Trail near Fort Steele at the end of three days.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h3>AMONG THE MORMONS.</h3>
<p>In my ride across the Territory of Utah
amid its snow-capped mountains, hot
sulphur springs and its great Salt Lake,
I met no hostile Indians, but on the
contrary many hospitable Mormons; in
fact, my reception by both Mormon
and Gentile was invariably kind and
generous. I saw something of the social
life of Utah as well as the wonderful
country through which I passed, and was favorably
impressed with the material development of the latter,
as witnessed in its farms and mechanical industries.
The men I conversed with were fairly intelligent—some
exceptionally so; and hesitated not to explain
and justify their peculiar faith and domestic life.
They are certainly neither monsters nor murderers,
but men possessing good manners and many of them
refined tastes. In short, I found much good human
nature among this people as well as social culture.
Business intelligence and activity is a marked feature
in their intercourse with strangers.</p>
<p>In Utah agriculture is the chief occupation of the
people. The long dry summers and the clayey character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
of the soil insure defeat to the farmer, unless he
helps his crops by artificial means. Irrigation is
therefore universal, and the result—the finest crops to
be found anywhere in the West.</p>
<p>The Territory of Utah covers the region drained by
the Great Salt Lake and many miles more, both in
length and breadth, but the Mormon settlements extend
one hundred miles further into Idaho on the
north and two hundred miles into Arizona on the
south. These settlements are mostly small, but there
are some places of considerable importance, as, for instance,
Provo at the south and Ogden at the north.</p>
<p>On July 14, 1847, Brigham Young, a Mormon
leader, and his followers entered the valley of the
Great Salt Lake. The lake itself is one of the most
remarkable bodies of water on the globe. It is seventy
miles long and forty-five miles broad, and stands 4,250
feet above the sea-level. It bears a strong resemblance
to the Dead Sea of Palestine, but, unlike that sea, it
abounds in animal life. When Young entered the
valley Utah belonged to Mexico, and the leader believed
he could found whatever character of institution
should suit him and his people best. It has been
alleged that Brigham Young had "chains on men's
souls." There is no doubt that superstition and the
machinery of the Mormon Church were in some degree
the secret of his irresistible power over his followers;
but back of the superstition and the marvellous church
organization stood the brain of a great and masterful
man. His power, he knew, must rest upon something
material and tangible, and this something he reasonably
discerned to be the prosperity of the people themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
He proved himself to be an organizer of prosperity,
and this was the real source of his strength.</p>
<p>Mormonism is the religion of 250,000 of the world's
inhabitants. The Territory of Utah has a population
of 160,000, and of these, probably, 110,000 are Mormons.
Their doctrines may be explained in a few
words:</p>
<p>They believe that both matter and spirit are eternal,
and both are possessed of intelligence and power to
design.</p>
<p>The spiritual realm contains many gods, all of whom
are traced back to one Supreme Deity.</p>
<p>This Supreme Deity and all the gods resemble men
and differ only in the fact that they are immortal.</p>
<p>In form they are the same as men, having every
organ and limb that belongs to humanity. They have
many wives, and are as numerous as the sands upon
the sea-shore.</p>
<p>Among the gods, Jesus Christ holds the first place,
and is the express image of the Supreme Father.</p>
<p>A general assembly of the gods, presided over by
the Supreme Deity, is the creating power.</p>
<p>When this world was created, Adam and Eve were
taken from the family of gods and placed in it. In
the fall they lost all knowledge of their heavenly
origin, became possessed of mortal bodies, and only
regained what they had lost by the quickening of the
Holy Spirit and continuous progress in knowledge and
purity.</p>
<p>Among other creations of the gods are innumerable
spirits which can only attain to the rank of gods by
the rugged road of discipline and trial trod by our first
parents. These spirits are constantly hovering over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
our earth waiting for fleshy tenements in which to begin
the steep ascent.</p>
<p>As soon as a child is born, one of these spirits takes
possession of it and is then fairly launched forth upon
its heavenly voyage.</p>
<p>Those who do not listen to the teachings of the
church here will, at death, enter upon a third estate
or probationary sphere, when they will have another
opportunity, when, if they improve it aright, they will,
with all the faithful, enter upon the fourth estate,
which is the estate of the gods.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is a material substance filling all
space, and can perform all the works of the Supreme
Deity. It is omnipresent; in animals it is instinct, in
man reason and inspiration, enabling him to prophesy,
speak with tongues, and perform miracles of healing
and many other wonderful things. The Holy Spirit
can be imparted by the laying on of hands by a priesthood
properly constituted and duly authorized.</p>
<p>The two prominent features of Mormonism are polygamy
and lust for power. Salvation is not so much
a matter of character as of the number of family.</p>
<p>Such is the teaching of Brigham Young in his sermons,
and of George Q. Cannon, Heber Kimball, and
of all the leading Mormons.</p>
<p>Social life among this people may be judged of from
the Mormon estimate of woman. She exists only as a
necessity in man's exaltation and glory. Her only
hope of a future life depends upon her being united
in "celestial marriage" to some man. Thus joined,
she will have a share in her husband's glory. In
marrying her, her husband confers upon her the greatest
possible honor, and for this she must be his obedient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
slave. In order that she may be contented with her
lot as a polygamous wife, she is taught from childhood
to look upon conjugal love as a weak and foolish sentiment,
and upon marriage as the only way to secure a
future life.</p>

</div>
<p>The Mormons have been largely recruited in numbers
by immigrants who have been brought into Utah
through the efforts of missionaries sent by the church
to other parts of America and to Europe. About six
thousand missionaries are thus employed. They leave
their homes in Utah and go to any part of the world
to which they may be assigned by the authorities of
the church, paying their own expenses, or collecting
the money for their sustenance from their converts.
These missionaries usually travel in pairs, and preach,
for the most part, in ignorant communities. It is
estimated that about 100,000 immigrants have gone to
Utah under their leadership. The organization of the
missionary force is very complete and effective. The
immigrants, though for the most part ignorant, are
always able-bodied, and are usually industrious, frugal,
and obedient to discipline. The average yearly immigration
is about 2,000 persons.</p>
<p>Mormonism has lately spread into the State of
Nevada, and into Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and
Arizona.</p>
<p>The sect was founded by Joseph Smith at Manchester,
New York, in 1830. Smith was born December
23, 1805, at Sharon, Vermont. When only fifteen
years old he began to have alleged visions, in one of
which, he asserts, the angel Moroni appeared to him
three times and told him that the Bible of the Western
Continent—a supplement to the New Testament—was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
buried in a certain spot near Manchester. Four years
after this event he visited the spot indicated by the
angel, and asserts that he had delivered into his charge
by another angel a stone box, in which was a volume,
six inches thick, made of thin gold plates, eight inches
long by seven broad, and fastened together by three
gold rings. The plates were said to be covered with
small writing in the Egyptian character, and were
accompanied by a pair of supernatural spectacles, consisting
of two crystals set in a silver bow and called
"Urim and Thummim." By aid of these the mystic
characters could be read. Joseph Smith, being himself
unable to read or write fluently, employed an amanuensis
to whom he dictated a translation, which was
afterward, in 1830, printed and published under the
title of the "Book of Mormon." The book professes to
give the history of America from its first settlement by
a colony of refugees from the crowd dispersed by the
confusion of tongues at the Tower of Babel. These
settlers having in the course of time destroyed one
another, nothing of importance occurred until 600
<span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, when Lehi, his wife and four sons, with ten
friends, all from Jerusalem, landed on the coast of
Chili, and from that period, according to the Mormon
theory, America became gradually peopled.</p>
<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Ogden.</span></div>
<p>Having heard much of the city of Ogden in Northern
Utah—of its peculiar origin and rapid progress—I
resolved to rest there for a day or two before proceeding
to Corinne and other points in my route toward
the Sierras.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>
<p>The pretty city of Ogden has had one of the wildest
and most thrilling of birthplaces.</p>
<p>To-day it reminds the stranger of one of the peaceful
little cities of old Massachusetts, nestled among the
Berkshire Hills, wide of street, stately of architecture,
redolent of comfort and refinement.</p>
<p>But in reality Ogden is the child of Utah. Mines
of precious metals are its neighbors. It has been the
scene of daring explorations, of Indian raids, and of
many murders and massacres. Its original inhabitants
were fanatics, so enthused with, so overwhelmed by their
tenets, as to believe themselves of all the world the
favorites of the Almighty, the only original handful
of His saints, the small remnant of the human family
to which constant revelations from Heaven were
vouchsafed.</p>
<p>Upheld by this fanaticism, drawn with it as by a
magnet from all over the United States, from Canada,
from the countries of Europe, proselytes came to join
the Mormons. They journeyed by mule trains over the
Plains, or they walked perhaps, pushing their all in
hand-carts before them. They encountered persecution,
suffering, and even death, undaunted. Some of them,
on their perilous journey to the Promised Land, subsisted
on roots. Some boiled the skins of their buffalo
robes and ate them. Some pushed their little carts on
the last day of their lives and then laid down to freeze
before the land of their desire was in sight. Graves or
skeletons frequently marked their route of march, but
still they came, and having come they prospered.</p>
<p>Their farms throve; their boundaries increased;
their settlements became many.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>
<p>With foolhardiness, but also with desperation, with
dauntless effrontery, with infinite pluck, they defied
the United States and her army, using the tiny handful
of Mormon soldiery in a way that makes one's
mind run back to the story of Thermopylæ.</p>
<p>Such was the blood that settled Ogden.</p>
<p>It was such inhabitants that Brigham Young, in
1850, advised to "put up good dwellings, open good
schools, erect a meeting-house, cultivate gardens, and
pay especial care to fruit raising," so that Ogden might
become a permanent settlement and the headquarters
for the Mormons in the northern portion of the Territory.</p>
<p>So well was his advice carried out that in 1851 the
city was "made a stake of Zion," divided into wards,
and incorporated by act of legislature.</p>
<p>From the very first, everything connected with the
city seemed to have a spice and dash about it.</p>
<p>Away back in 1540, Father Juan de Padilla and his
patron, Pedro de Tobar, went on an exploring expedition.
On his return the priest spoke of a large and
interesting river he had found in that "Great Unknown,"
the Northwest.</p>
<p>The account so fired the hearts of his brother Spaniards
that Captain Garcia Lopaz de Cardenas was sent
to explore further into that wonderland. He returned
telling of immense gulches, of rocky battlements, and
of mountains surrounding a great body of water.
Many believe that in that far distant time, about the
time that Elizabeth ascended the throne of England,
before Raleigh had done himself the honor of his discoveries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
and settlements in Virginia, Signor Cardenas
was simply taking a little vacation trip through Utah.</p>
<p>But however fabulous that may be, we know of a
surety that on July 29, 1776, two Franciscan friars
set out from Santa Fé to find a direct route to the
Pacific Ocean. In their wanderings they strayed far
to the north, where they came across many representatives
of the Utes, who proved to be a loving, faithful,
hospitable people. From their lips the Spaniards
heard the first description ever listened to by white
men of the region of country containing the present
site of Ogden. "The lake," the Utes said, "occupies
many leagues. Its waters are injurious and extremely
salt. He that wets any part of his body in this water
immediately feels an itching in the wet parts. In the
circuit of this lake live a numerous and quiet nation
called Puaguampe. They feed on herbs, and drink
from various fountains or springs of good water which
are about the lake, and they have their little houses of
grass and earth, which latter forms the roof."</p>
<p>So the Great Salt Lake makes its entrance into comparatively
modern American history.</p>
<p>In 1825, Peter Skeen Ogden, accompanied by
his party of Hudson Bay Company trappers, pursued
his brilliant adventures, and left behind a record which
induced the naming of the city after him.</p>
<p>In 1841, the country around the spot where the city
now lies was held, on a Spanish grant, by Miles M.
Goodyear, who built a fort and a few log-houses near
the confluence of the Weber and Ogden rivers.</p>
<p>On June 6, 1848, a man named James Brown
came from California with his pockets stuffed with
gold dust; nearly five thousand dollars' worth of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
precious thing had he. With part of it he bought this
tract of land from Goodyear. It proved to be a most
fertile spot. Brethren came to it from Salt Lake City.
Gentiles came from everywhere. The settlement grew
and prospered.</p>
<p>In 1849, people began to talk of locating a city right
there at the junction of the two rivers.</p>
<p>In 1850, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and
others, laid out the settlement and called it Ogden,
after Peter Skeen Ogden, the explorer, long since dead,
but whose dashing, daring, brilliant adventures were
still charming to the men of that wild land. Every
time the city's name is mentioned it is another proof
that although,</p>
<div class="center">
"The man might die, his memory lives."</div>
<p>Before a year was over a school house was built in
the city.</p>
<p>Then came that un-American sight, a wall of protection
built around a city. It cost $40,000, which
amount was raised by taxation.</p>
<p>About this time several suburban settlements were
formed, but bears, wolves, and Indians soon drove the
venturesome suburbanites within city limits.</p>
<p>Just then a party of immigrants encamping on the
Malade River shot two Indian women. By way of
reprisal the savages killed a pioneer named Campbell
who was building a saw-mill near Ogden, and threatened
to massacre the entire population of the town. Matters
began to look serious, and the commander of the
Nauvoo Legion gave the Indians chase, and so overwhelmed
them that they at once retreated, taking with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
them no captives more important than many horses and
cattle belonging to the white settlers.</p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption65">

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption65">SHEEP RANCHE IN WYOMING.</span>
</div>
<p>October 23, 1851, the first municipal election was
held in Ogden.</p>
<p>1852 found one hundred families living within city
boundaries.</p>
<p>In 1854, a memorial was addressed to Congress, by
the territorial legislature, urging the construction of
an overland railroad. But it was May, 1868, before a
contract was made between Brigham Young and the
superintendent of construction of the Union Pacific
Railroad for grading between Echo Canyon and the
terminus of the line. At Weber Canyon there was
blasting, tunnelling, and heavy stone work for bridges
to be done. This work earned 1,000,000 or perhaps
1,250,000 dollars' worth of wages. The labor was
splendidly done, but the remuneration came slowly.
Finally, however, the Union Pacific Railroad turned
over 600,000 dollars' worth of rolling stock, and other
property to the Mormons. On May 17, 1869, ground
was broken for a railroad between Salt Lake City and
Ogden. So the city grew and flourished.</p>
<p>Ogden has an elevation of 4,340 feet. The ground
plan of the city is spacious, the drainage good, the
climate exceedingly healthy.</p>
<p>About the time I rode through, the population numbered
6,000 souls. The city contained one of the
finest schools in Utah, a hotel which ranked among
the best in the Union, a daily paper, a theatre, three
banks, numerous Gentile churches, a 16,000 dollar
bridge across the Weber, a reservoir, and a Court
House, which was such an architectural beauty that
all Utah may well be proud of it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504">[504]</a></span></p>
<p>So Ogden came through narrow ways to broad
ways! So she</p>
<div class="center">
"Climbed the ladder, round by round!"
</div>
<p>She has won the respect and admiration of all who
have watched her. May her industry never fail, her
enthusiasm never lessen, her pluck remain indomitable,
and may good fortune perch forever on her banners!</p>

seen against the sky.</p>

</div>
<p>My main object now was to push on
to Sacramento. At Kelton, in Utah,
where I remained only a few hours, I
was still seven hundred and ninety miles
from my destination. Stock is extensively
grazed here and cattle shipped to the Pacific
coast in very large numbers. Leaving Kelton, I rode
thirty-three miles to Terrace, a small settlement in the
midst of a desert; thence to Wells in the adjoining
State of Nevada.</p>
<p>Nevada belongs to the "Great Basin," a table-land
elevated 4,500 feet above the sea. It is traversed,
with great uniformity, by parallel mountain ranges,
rising from 1,000 to 8,000 feet high, running north
and south. Long, narrow valleys, or canyons, lie between
them. The Sierra Nevada, in some places
13,000 feet in height, extends along the western
boundary of the State. The only navigable river is
the Colorado, but there are several other streams rising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
in the mountains and emptying into lakes which
have no visible outlet. Lake Tahoe is twenty-one
miles long, ten miles wide and fifteen hundred feet
deep. Although it is elevated 6,000 feet above the
sea level, the water of this lake never freezes and has
a mean temperature of 57° for the year. Nevada has
its hot springs, some of which have a temperature of
two hundred degrees.</p>
<p>A heavy growth of timber, particularly of pine, fir,
and spruce, covers the eastern slopes of the Sierra
Nevada, many of the trees attaining enormous size.
There are numerous alkaline flats, and extensive sand
plains, where nothing grows. The first discovery of
silver ore was made on the Comstock lode in 1859,
from which more than $100,000,000 have been taken.
This has been the most valuable silver-bearing lode
ever discovered in the world, exceeding in wealth the
mines of Peru and Mexico. It is now exhausted and
yields only low-grade ores.</p>
<p>Wells, my first resting-point in the Sierras, stands
at an elevation of over 5,600 feet, and had a population
of less than 300. Farming and stock raising are
its principal industries. Formerly it was a watering
and resting-place for old emigrant travel, where pure
water was obtained—a luxury after crossing the Great
Desert; and an abundance of grass for the weary animals.
Some of the wells here are 1,700 feet deep.</p>
<p>Stopped next for the night at Halleck, a small village—over
5,000 feet elevation—thirteen miles from
Camp Halleck, where United States troops are occasionally
stationed. Leaving Halleck after a night's rest
and a hearty breakfast of ham and eggs, I rode twenty-four
miles to Elko, six hundred and nineteen miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
from San Francisco. This important town stands at
an elevation of 5,063 feet above sea-level and is on the
Humboldt River. The State University is situated
here. Silver smelting works and manufactures of
farming implements were the principal industries.
One daily and two weekly papers were well supported.
There were also three large freight depots for the
accommodation of the railway business. I noticed several
Indians about the town. The hot mineral springs
of Elko are considered of great value for bathing.
Population at the time of my visit, about 1,700, but
the town is destined to develop into an important city.
The money paid for freights consigned to this place,
averaged $1,000,000 a year.</p>
<p>Leaving Elko, I pushed on for thirty miles. The
pastures and meadows, with isolated cottages, were
soon passed and I reached Palisade in the evening, a
village of 250 inhabitants. Remained here for the
night. For the last two hundred miles the road had
been a gradual descent and the change of temperature
was very perceptible. Palisade is a growing little
place with a population of about 400 souls. It is
located about half-way down a canyon, whose rocky,
perpendicular walls give it a singular but picturesque
appearance.</p>
<p>My mustang carried me forty-one miles next day,
to Argentina, where I rested. This village is located
in the midst of alkali flats and seemed to me an unattractive
place for a residence. Continuing my journey
along the foot of Reese River Mountain, I soon
found myself at Battle Mountain, at the junction of
Reese River and Humboldt valleys. The town of
Battle Mountain has several stores, a public hall, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
good school house and an excellent hotel; with increasing
trade. The mountain from which the town derives
its name is about three miles south of the latter
and is said to have been the scene of a conflict between
a party of emigrants and a band of Indians.</p>
<p>Golconda was reached on the evening of the following
day—four hundred and seventy-eight miles from
San Francisco. Here are gold and silver mines, but
the place was small and calls for no further remark.
Remounted at sunrise the following morning and rode
to Winnemucca, the county-seat of Humboldt County.
The town has a fine brick Court House, together with
several stores, a hotel, shops and a school house.</p>
<p>Reached Humboldt the following day, where I was
reminded that I was still in the land of civilization.
Stopped at the Humboldt House, a most comfortable
hostelry, its surroundings recalling my home in the
East. Humboldt is the business centre of several
mining districts and has a bright prospect before it.</p>
<p>Lovelocks, the next point reached, is also on the
Central Pacific Railroad. It is a grazing region, and
large herds of cattle are fattened upon the rich native
grasses. Leaving Lovelocks, I found myself again on
a barren desert, covered in places with salt and alkali
deposits. Another station in the midst of this desert is
Hot Springs. Pushing forward I reached Desert,
three hundred and thirty-five miles from San Francisco.
The village is rightly named, for it is, in truth, a
dreary place. I was much relieved on reaching
Wadsworth, a town of about 700 inhabitants, and only
three hundred and twenty-eight miles from the end of
my journey. Some large stores here do a flourishing
business. There are also several good hotels, in one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
which I was soon comfortably housed. For several
days I had seen nothing but dreary, monotonous plains,
and now, almost another world opened to my view—a
world of beauty and sublimity. It was with reluctance
I left Wadsworth and crossed the Truckee River.
The trees, green meadows, comfortable farmhouses, and
well-tilled fields, were pleasant to look upon, and with
the prospect of soon reaching my final destination, I
rode on, and crossed the boundary into California.</p>

<p>Truckee, although within the State of California, is
in the Sierra Nevada, one hundred and twenty-one
miles from Sacramento. The village is handsomely
built, the surroundings picturesque and finely timbered,
and there is a line of stages running to the beautiful
Lakes Tahoe and Donner.</p>

<h3>ALONG THE SACRAMENTO.</h3>
<p>From Truckee I rode along the line of
the Central Pacific Railroad, stopping for
the night at villages intermediate between
Truckee and Sacramento, the principal of
which were Summit, Colfax and Auburn.
Summit is the highest point of the pass
through which the railroad crosses the
Sierra Nevada, its height above sea-level
being 7,042 feet. The population was
only a little over one hundred. Colfax, fifty-four
miles from Sacramento, had a population of nearly six
hundred, mostly employed in the gold mines in the
vicinity. Auburn, thirty-six miles from Sacramento,
is also a gold-mining village. Its population was
given me as over 1,200. Two weekly papers are published
here, and three hotels offer good accommodations
to tourists and others. Sacramento was reached
November twenty-first, and here I found myself within
a hundred miles of my destination.</p>
<p>California has the Pacific Ocean for its western
boundary. Along the seaboard lies the Coast Range of
mountains, while for an eastern boundary of the State
stretch the Sierras. Between these two chains lies
many a hill, yet, in the main, the whole interior of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
State is a great depression, called the Valley of California.
The northern portion is called again the Sacramento
Valley; the southern, the Valley of San
Joaquin, both named for the streams that water them.</p>

</div>
<p>The inhabitants are a motley set; English, Celts,
Spaniards, Mexicans, Indians, and above all the man
from the eastern part of the United States, leaving his
impress on all, Americanizing all.</p>
<p>Sutter's Fort, as already explained, was founded in
1839, very near the junction of the Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys, by a Swiss named John A. Sutter.
It stood on a small hill, skirted by a creek which falls
into the American River near its junction with the
Sacramento, and overlooked a vast extent of ditch-enclosed
fields, and park stock ranges, broken by groves
and belts of timber. The settlement consisted of the
Fort and an old adobe house, called the hospital. A
garden of eight or ten acres, filled with vegetables and
tropical fruits, surrounded the Fort, cattle covered the
plains and boats were tied to the wharves.</p>
<p>Sutter's confirmed grant contained eleven leagues.</p>
<p>The Fort, so called, was a parallelogram. Its walls
were of adobe, its dimensions five hundred by one
hundred and fifty feet. It had loop-holes, bastions at
the angles, and twelve cannon.</p>
<p>Inside of the walls were granaries, warehouses, storehouses,
shops, and in the centre of it all the house of
the commander, the potentate, Sutter. His house was
rough, "Bare rafters and unpanelled walls." Many of
the rooms were roughly furnished, crude benches and
deal tables. Fine China bowls did duty for both cups
and plates, and silver spoons were the only luxury
which marked the service of the meals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518">[518]</a></span></p>
<p>For his private apartments Sutter obtained from
the Russians a clumsy set of California laurel furniture.</p>
<p>In front of his house, yet within the stockade, was
a tiny square containing one brass gun, by which, day
and night, paced a sentry, stopping only at the belfry
post to chime the hours.</p>
<p>The Fort was a business centre. In it was located a
blacksmith, a carpenter, and a general variety and
liquor store. Prices were booming. Four dollars
were charged for shoeing a horse. Wheat sold for
one dollar per bushel, peas for a dollar and a half
per bushel.</p>
<p>A sort of gravel road led to the spot, over which
horses galloped, and heavy wagons rolled.</p>
<p>Sutter owned twelve thousand cattle, two thousand
horses and mules, from one thousand to fifteen hundred
sheep, and two thousand hogs.</p>
<p>This unique Fort was "the capital of the vast interior
valley, pregnant with approaching importance."</p>
<p>In 1846, Sutter staked out the town of Sutterville,
three miles below the Fort on the Sacramento, and built
the first house there. His example was shortly followed
by a man named Zims, who erected the first
real brick structure in the State.</p>
<p>The Fort and town kept up regular communication
with San Francisco by means of a twenty-ton sloop
owned by Sutter, and manned by a few savages in his
employ.</p>
<p>There was a ferry at the Fort, which consisted of a
single canoe handled by an Indian.</p>
<p>The strangest of populations gathered about the settlement.
Emigrants were there, many Mormons
among them. Native Californians were there, wearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
sombreros, sashes, and jingling spurs. Half-subdued
Indians abounded, wrapped in their blankets,
and decked with beads and feathers. While here and
there appeared a shrewd Yankee, come across mountains
of snow and rocks to seek his fortune.</p>
<p>The climate of Sacramento is charming, the average
temperature in winter being 45°; that in summer
69°. The thermometer does not vary ten degrees between
night and day. The sea breezes are constant,
leaving rarely an uncooled night. Rainfall is a tenth
less than on the Atlantic Coast. Early autumn finds
this region dry and arid; its small streams dried up,
the green fields sere, the weeds snapping like glass.</p>
<p>The winter rain begins in November, after six
months of clear weather, and under its grateful ministry
the region "buds and blossoms like the rose."</p>
<p>John A. Sutter, potentate of the region, in 1847,
needed lumber, and therefore needed a saw-mill. His
neighbors wanted lumber, too, and there would be a
good market for it in San Francisco. Therefore a saw-mill
would be profitable; but no trees suitable for this
purpose could be found short of the foot-hills. Consequently
the foot-hills were selected as the spot upon
which he would build.</p>
<p>He engaged a motley company of all nationalities to
erect his mill, appointing James Wilson Marshall, a
native of New Jersey, as superintendent of the venture.</p>
<p>In August they started for their new field of enterprise,
taking their belongings in Mexican ox-carts, and
driving a flock of sheep before them for food.</p>
<p>By New Year's day, 1848, the mill frame was up.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of January twenty-fourth, Superintendent
Marshall was inspecting the tail-race of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
mill. There had been a heavy flood, which had previously
retreated, and to his surprise Marshall found
the ground thickly strewn with a peculiar yellow dust.
He stooped down and gathered some of it, remarking
quietly, "Boys, I believe I have found a gold mine!"
Then he began some simple tests upon the metal.
Gold must be heavy. He weighed it. That was all
right. Gold must be malleable. He bit and pounded
it, and it stood the test. Then he applied <i>aqua fortis</i>
to it, and it responded as it should. And so the truth
was known at last. It was gold, and the ground was
full of it.</p>
<p>Marshall saddled his horse, and dashed over to consult
with Sutter, and together they agreed to keep the
matter quiet, and if possible to buy up the surrounding
land. But how to buy it. That was the question!
They leased it from its semi-barbaric owners, paying
for it in hats and trinkets, but that title seemed insecure.
The Mexican government could no longer
give grants. The United States government was appealed
to in vain. The answer came that California
was held as a conquered province, and no title deed
could be executed.</p>
<p>And meantime the precious secret leaked out. Sutter
was impelled to write the wonderful news to friends
at a distance. All the men at the saw-mill knew of
the discovery. One of them, named Bennett, while in
a store near Monte del Diablo, pulled out of his pocket
a bag of gold dust, exclaiming, "I have something
here which will make this the greatest country in the
world." The same man took a specimen of the precious
metal and showed it at San Francisco. A few days
later an intoxicated Swede offered, at a store, to pay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
for his drink in gold dust. Then a Mormon must tell
his fellow-saints of the discovery. So the secret was
out, and the precious mystery became public.</p>
<p>Both Sutter and Marshall were backwoodsmen, unsophisticated,
child-like, trustful, slow. They hesitated,
they faltered, they delayed mining, and they
were lost! Before they fully comprehended the matter,
the great world had rushed in, and taken possession
of the treasure.</p>
<p>In the last issue of <i>The Californian</i> appears this only
too true statement: "The whole country from San
Francisco to Los Angeles, and from the sea-shore to
the base of the Sierra Nevada, resounds to the sordid cry
of gold! <span class="smcap">GOLD!!</span> GOLD!!! while the field is left
half planted, the house half built, and everything neglected
but the manufacture of shovels and pick-axes,
and the means of transportation to the spot where one
man obtained one hundred and twenty-eight dollars'
worth of the real stuff in one day's washing, and the
average for all concerned is twenty dollars per diem."</p>
<p>In the rush Marshall and Sutter were crushed.</p>
<p>Marshall had little or no money to invest. He was
particularly unfortunate in locating his small claims.
Worst of all, the miners, knowing him to be the great
discoverer, followed him <i>en masse</i>, believing that he
knew the secrets of the hills and rivers. The crowds
so overwhelmed him, that he had no chance to mine.
They even threatened to hang him if he did not lead
them to the finest diggings. In a few years after, he
died, miserable, broken-hearted, poverty-stricken.</p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption69">A CASCADE BY THE ROADSIDE.</span>
</div>
<p>Sutter fared but little better. True, he sold a half-interest
in his saw-mill for six thousand dollars, and
he gained something from the mining of his Indians,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
but Sutter's Fort was, for the time being, ruined. Let
him tell the story in his own words. He says:<a id="Page_525"></a></p>
<p>"My grist mill was never finished. Everything
was stolen, even the stones. There is a saying that
men will steal everything but a mile-stone and a mill-stone.
They stole my mill-stones. They stole the
bells from the Fort, and gate-weights; the hides they
stole, and salmon barrels. I had two hundred barrels
which I made for salmon. Some of the cannon at the
fort were stolen. * * My property was all left exposed,
and at the mercy of the rabble, when gold was
discovered. My men all deserted me. I could not
shut the gates of my Fort, and keep out the rabble.
They would have broken them down. The country
swarmed with lawless men. Emigrants drove their
stock into my yard, and used my grain with impunity.
Expostulation did no good. I was alone. There was
no law."</p>
<p>In face of all these disadvantages he struggled on
until farm helpers demanded ten dollars per day, then,
a hopeless old man, he gave up the struggle, and in
1849, with his Indians, he moved into Hock Farm,
little dreaming that his Fort was to be the nucleus for
Sacramento, the second city as to size in California.</p>
<p>He retired, but his son took the reins out of the
father's feeble hands, and staked out a town around
the Old Fort, down to the embarcadero, and along the
river front, naming the settlement Sacramento. The
streets were laid out eighty feet wide, except the centre
one, M street, which was one hundred feet in width.
The purchasing of more than four lots by one person
was discouraged.</p>
<p>At first Sacramento was a "city of tents, with its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
future on paper;" but by April of that year, 1849,
building lots were selling at from one thousand to
three thousand dollars a piece; at that time there were
twenty-five or thirty stores upon the embarcadero, and,
in the vicinity of the Fort, eight or ten more. There
was a hotel, a printing office, bakery, blacksmith's
shop, tin-shop, billiard room, and bowling alley.</p>
<p>In that month of April, the city had the honor of
becoming a port of entry.</p>
<p>By June of the same year, one hundred houses
graced the city.</p>
<p>A few months later the city hotel was completed at
a cost of one hundred thousand dollars, and rented to
Messrs. Fowler and Fry for five thousand dollars per
month.</p>
<p>In 1850, the scourge of cholera broke out, carrying
off one-fifth of those remaining in Sacramento. The
city was full to overflowing with a transient population.
Accommodations were scant and primitive, vice
and disorder prevailed. The disease became rampant.
Patients at the hospital were charged sixteen dollars
per day. Then it was that the order of Odd Fellows
came nobly forward, setting to that plague-stricken
district an example of charity and philanthropy long
to be remembered, and accenting the fact "that simple
duty has no place for fear!"</p>
<p>On February 25, 1854, Sacramento was designated
as the seat of government of California. The dignity
of being the State capital gave new life to the
city. Her growth is instanced by the assessment on
real estate, which rose from $5,400,000 in 1854, to
$13,000,000 in twenty years.</p>
<p>When I rode through, the population was 21,400.</p>
<p>In 1853 the streets were planked, and provided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
with sewers. In 1854 a gas company was formed.
The street railroad came in 1870. There were ten
churches in the city as I found it.</p>
<p>The first public school came in 1855, the high
school in 1856.</p>
<p>When I was there the city had sustained from time to
time about forty daily papers and twenty-four weeklies.</p>
<p>The State Library is a brilliant feature of the place.
Various large manufacturing interests thrive in the
city. Its commerce is awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>Sacramento sent to the east in one year 90,000,000
pounds of fruit, her entire east-bound shipments being
over 130,000,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The annual manufacturing and jobbing trade is
over $60,000,000.</p>
<p>Looking at these statistics, one is reminded of the
magic tent of Prince Ahmed. At first it was no bigger
than a nut-shell. Surely it could hold nothing;
but it did. People flocked to it. Surely it could not
cover them;—but it did! it did!! The army flocked
to it;—but the tent was elastic. It covered all; it
sheltered all; it welcomed all.</p>
<p>Has not Sacramento proved itself the magic tent of
the Golden Age, ready to cover, shelter, welcome the
whole world should occasion require?</p>
<p>From Sacramento to San Francisco my route lay
along the eastern shore of the river, and few halts
were made between the two cities. I was anxious to
reach my final destination, as a feeling of fatigue was now
overcoming me, which, however, only served to stimulate
and urge me forward. I passed several places that
strongly tempted a halt for refreshment and rest, and
finally entered the Western Metropolis on the twenty-fourth
of November, registering at the Palace Hotel.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<h3>SAN FRANCISCO AND END OF JOURNEY.</h3>
<p>San Francisco, the chief city on the
Western Coast of North America, is in
every respect a wonderful city, not least
so in its origin and development. Not
very long ago—less than a century—the
Pacific Coast was almost an unexplored
region. The great State of
California—next to Texas, the largest in
the Union—now teems with populous
cities and new settlements, and produces meat and
grain abundantly sufficient for the supply of a large
portion of the country. It has a coast line on the
Pacific Ocean of seven hundred miles and, extending
from the coast, a breadth of three hundred and thirty
miles. California has also the most wonderful gold
fields of the world. They were discovered in the
middle of the last century by the Jesuits, who kept the
knowledge a secret.</p>
<p>In 1848, as previously stated, Captain Sutter found
gold on the land of one of his farms, and the news of
the discovery at once spread. The excitement extended
throughout the Union and the "Argonauts of
'49" came swarming to the gold fields. People ran
about picking up the precious lumps as "hogs in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
forest root for ground-nuts." The golden product of
1848, was $10,000,000; 1849, $40,000,000; and that
of 1853, $65,000,000.</p>
<p>Silver mining has been attempted in many localities
in the State, but generally with poor results. There
are valuable deposits of iron ore, coal, copper, tin,
platinum, manganese, asphalt, petroleum, lead and
zinc. Fruits are abundant, of great size, and are sold
in all the Eastern markets.</p>
<p>The constitution of California requires a free school
to be supported in each district six months in each
year, and the system includes primary and grammar
schools, high schools, evening schools, normal schools,
technical schools, and the State University, which is
free to both sexes, and is a perpetual public trust.
The schools of California are justly famous.</p>
<p>Upper California was discovered in 1538 by a Spanish
navigator. In 1578, Sir Francis Drake visited it
and gave it the name of New Albion. The Spaniards
planted the first colony in 1768. The territory was
purchased from Mexico by the United States in 1847
for $15,000,000. A constitution was adopted in the
same year, and in 1850, California, without ever having
been under a territorial government, was admitted
into the Union as a State.</p>
<p>The progress of California has been of the most
substantial character. Gold mining has become a
staple industry, but in the agricultural capabilities of
her soil lie the possibilities of her greatest wealth.
Among the most valuable of her industries in the
future will be those of the orchard and the vineyard.
The grape growers of the State can now sell their
grapes with as much certainty as the farmer his wheat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
There is sent to the Atlantic coast more wine than
is imported from France, the heretofore wine market
of the world.</p>
<p>In Central California a little peninsula juts out from
the main land, a great harbor is on one side, a great
ocean on the other. The lofty mountains, lower just
here, form, as it were, a natural gateway to the great
interior beyond.</p>
<p>Here, in 1836, an American named John P. Lease
settled, and here, in time, a little town called San
Francisco grew up around him. Two miles to the
south loomed up the antiquated building of the Catholic
Mission Dolores, with its pretty old gardens. The
opposite shores of the bay presented a most beautiful
park-like expanse: the native lawn, brilliant with
flowers and dotted by eastward bending oaks, watered
by the creeks of the Alameda, San Lorenzo, San
Leandro, and their tributaries, and enclosed by the
spurs of the Diablo Mountains.</p>
<p>San Francisco was on the soil of Mexico, under the
flag of Anàhuac, governed by an Alcalde and a sapient
council, yet the spirit of the United States breathed
in it, built its stout wooden houses, and thronged its
busy wharves. Animated by this spirit, it was destined
to become the metropolis of the Pacific, one of
the noted cities of the globe.</p>
<p>Before the "Golden Age," while California was a
peaceful settlement, of no especial importance, it was
said that around San Francisco Bay there was raw
material enough, of different types, to develop a new
race.</p>
<p>San Francisco was not in the gold region, but it
was the gate to that region.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532">[532]</a></span></p>
<p>Two weeks after Marshall first discovered the
precious metal, a bag of it was brought to the city for
analysis, and one day early in May, 1848, "Samuel
Brennan, the Mormon leader, held a bottle of gold
dust in one hand, and jubilantly swinging his hat in
the other, passed through the streets of San Francisco
shouting, 'Gold! Gold!! Gold!!! from the American
River!'"</p>
<p>This started the enthusiasm, the fever, the madness
for gold.</p>
<p>Carson writes his sensations when first looking upon
a well-filled bag of gold dust. He says:</p>
<p>"A frenzy seized my soul, unbidden my legs performed
some entirely new movements of polka steps.
* * Houses were too small for me to stay in. I
was soon in the street in search of necessary outfits;
piles of gold rose up before me at every step."</p>
<p>All yielded more or less to the subtle influence of
the malady. Men hastened to arrange their affairs,
dissolving partnerships, disposing of real estate, and
converting other effects into ready means for departure.</p>
<p>Stores were rummaged for miners' tools.</p>
<p>One man offered as high as fifty dollars for a shovel.
By the middle of June, San Francisco was without
male population. The once bustling little town looked
as if struck by a plague. Sessions of the town council
were at an end. There were no church services.
Stores were closed. Newspapers dropped out of existence.
Merchandise lay unhandled on the docks. The
sailors deserted the ships that lay at anchor in the bay.</p>
<p>One day a Peruvian bark came to anchor in the
port. Amazed at the desolation which he beheld,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
the captain inquired the cause. He was answered,
"Everybody has gone northward, where the valleys
and mountains are of gold." Instantly upon hearing
this marvellous assertion his own crew joined the innumerable
throng.</p>

<span class="caption" id="ebm_caption70">VIEW IN WOODWARD'S GARDENS. SAN FRANCISCO.</span>
</div>
<p>The San Francisco <i>Star</i> of May 27, 1848, says:</p>
<p>"Stores are closed and places of business vacated, a
large number of houses are tenantless, various kinds of
mechanical labor suspended or given up entirely,
and nowhere the pleasant hum of industry salutes the
ear as of late. * * Everything in San Francisco
wears a desolate and sombre look; everywhere all is
dull, monotonous, dead."</p>
<p>Apparently the Californian of that day was thoroughly
imbued with the saying of the Cyclops, "The
wise know nothing worth worshipping but wealth."</p>
<p>The Pacific Mail Steamship Company was incorporated
in 1847, to sail from New York to New
Orleans and Chagres, and from Panama to such Pacific
port as the Secretary of the Navy might designate.
Later, when the existence of gold in her mines made
California the cynosure of all eyes, San Francisco was
decided upon as the western terminus of the route.</p>
<p>On October 6, 1848, the "California," the first vessel
of this line, steamed out of New York harbor,
with but a small number of passengers. As this ship
was intended for use on the Pacific coast alone, she
was obliged to take the tedious and perilous route
through the Strait of Magellan to reach her destination.
Arriving at Panama, she found the Isthmus
apparently turned into pandemonium. The one time
dingy, sleepy city of Panama appeared to have fallen
entirely into the hands of the gold-seekers. Cholera<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
had broken out with terrible malignity on the banks
of the Chagres. The panic-stricken travellers were
fleeing from the disease, some trying to reach the land
of their desire by an old trail, others were trying to
make some progress in boats called "longos," poled by
naked negroes. The mass of the worn, weary, eager
wayfarers, however, were waiting as best they might,
for that vision of hope and comfort, the "steamer." At
last she reached them, with accommodations for about
one hundred. She was mobbed by the frantic men, and
at last when she left port, over four hundred of them
had embarked upon her, many a man braving that adventurous
voyage, with only a coil of rope or a plank
for a bed.</p>
<p>Steerage tickets for the trip are said to have cost
one thousand dollars, or over.</p>
<p>After spending four months in her passage, the
"California" steamed into the Bay of San Francisco,
February 29, 1849, a day never to be forgotten at the
Golden Gate! The town was crowded with miners
wintering there; the ships in the harbor were gay
with bunting; the guns of the Pacific Squadron
boomed out a salute to the new-comers. Bands of
music played, handkerchiefs waved, and men cheered
in their enthusiasm, as the first steamship of a regular
line entered the Golden Gate, in pursuit of the treasures
of the "Golden Age."</p>
<p>That ship bore to California the new military commander,
General Persifor F. Smith.</p>
<p>So high ran the fever for treasure, that before the
passengers had fairly left the steamer, she was deserted
by all belonging to her, save one engineer, and she
was consequently unable to start on her return trip.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_537">[537]</a></span></p>
<p>Nor was it alone the "California" which was deserted.
Five hundred ships lay in the San Francisco
Harbor deserted, the crews, wild for gold, carrying off
the ship's boats in their eagerness to reach land; very
often the commander leading, or at least joining in the
flight. Many vessels that year were left to rot; many
were dragged on shore and used as lodging houses.</p>
<p>In the spring, San Francisco seemed deserted, only
two thousand inhabitants being left. The heart of the
city began to quail. Thousands thronging through
her harbor, yet so few to stay! But winter brought
the miners back to civilization again, and the population
swelled to twenty thousand.</p>
<p>San Francisco was at this time mainly a city of
tents, although there was a sprinkling of adobe houses,
and a few frame buildings. It was a community of
men. The census of 1850 showed that only eight per
cent. of the population were women. It was, moreover,
a community of young men; scarcely a grey
head was to be seen in it.</p>
<p>Men were there from all the European nations,
together with Moors and Abyssinians from Africa,
Mongols, Malays, and Hindoos from Asia and Australia.
Turks, Hebrews, and Hispano-Americans
jostled the ubiquitous Yankee, in the new streets of
San Francisco.</p>
<p>The predominant dress, we are told, was "checked
and woollen shirts, mainly red and blue, open at the
bosom which could boast of shaggy robustness, or
loosely secured by a kerchief; pantaloons tucked into
high and wrinkled boots, and belted at the waist,
where bristled an arsenal of knife and pistols. Beard
and hair emancipated from thraldom, revelled in long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
and bushy tufts, which rather harmonized with the
slouched and dingy hat. * * The gamblers affected
the Mexican style of dress, white shirt with diamond
studs, chain of native golden specimens, broad-brimmed
hat, with sometimes a feather or squirrel's tail tucked
under the brim, top-boots, and a rich scarlet sash or
silk handkerchief thrown over the shoulder, or wound
around the waist."</p>
<p>They were a buoyant race, brave, intrepid, light-hearted—above
all things free from restraint.</p>
<p>They had braved all hardships and dangers to reach
the land of their desire. They had reached there
safely, however, and they exulted. They overflowed
with activity; they worked jubilantly and untiringly.</p>
<p>They shouted, they fought, they gambled, in their
moments of recreation, intoxicated with the bracing
climate, with their excitement of success, and with that
rollicking freedom which threw off all shackles of custom
or self-restraint.</p>
<p>They worshipped success, and greatness with them
meant "fitness to grasp opportunity!"</p>
<p>In their eyes the unpardonable sin was meanness.</p>
<p>Fifty cents was the smallest sum which could be
offered for the most trivial of services.</p>
<p>Laborers obtained a dollar an hour, artisans twenty
dollars per day. Laundry expenses exceeded the
price of new underwear.</p>
<p>They loved grandeur. Bootblacks carried on business
in prettily fitted up recesses furnished with cushioned
chairs, and containing a liberal supply of newspapers.</p>
<p>It was over such a San Francisco that the frightful
plague of cholera swept in 1850, carrying with it a
lesser plague of suicide.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541">[541]</a></span></p>
<p>Doctors' fees were from sixteen to thirty-two dollars
per visit, while for a surgical operation one thousand
dollars was the usual price.</p>
<p>In spite of plague and death, that part of San Francisco
which escaped continued to be jubilant.</p>
<p>Bull fights were in high favor, and the stage, though
crude, was very popular, but the great, enchanting delight
of the city was gambling. Money, gold, jewelry,
houses, land and wharves were all put up to be gambled
for. The city abounded with men of elegant
manners and striking dress, who were professional
gamblers. It was indeed an advance in civilization
and morality when in September, 1850, a law was
passed forbidding this pastime on the Sabbath day.</p>

<p>The news that California had been admitted as a
State in the Union reached San Francisco on the morning
of October 18, 1850, when the "Oregon" entered the
harbor, flying all her bunting, and signalling the good
news. Business was suspended; courts were adjourned;
and the whole population, frenzied with delight,
congregated on Portsmouth Square to congratulate
each other. Newspapers containing the intelligence
from Washington sold for five dollars each!
The shipping in the harbor was gaily dressed with
flags; guns boomed from the heights; bonfires blazed
at night; processions were formed; bands played; and
the people in every way expressed their joy. Mounting
his box behind six fiery mustangs lashed to highest
speed, the driver of Crandall's Stage cried the good
news all the way to San José—"California is admitted!!"
while a ringing cheer was returned by the
people as the mail flew by.</p>
<p>The awaking of San Francisco during the five or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
six years following the discovery of gold was wonderful.
"Hills were tumbled into the bay, and mud
flats were made solid ground." Streets were graded,
handsome buildings were erected, and San Francisco
began to rank among the first cities of the land. So
valuable was her water-front that, in 1853, four small
blocks on Commercial street sold for over 1,000,000
dollars. The assessed valuation of property that year
was about 10,000,000 dollars over that of the previous
year.</p>
<p>The population was then estimated at about 50,000;
that being about one-seventh of the then population of
the State.</p>
<p>The city had, at this time, 1856, seventeen fire companies,
twelve military companies, and a number of
social clubs, four hospitals, seventeen public schools,
thirty-two church organizations, thirteen daily newspapers,
and as many weeklies published in half a
dozen different languages.</p>
<p>From that time she has continued ever increasing,
ever justifying her title of the metropolis of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Her City Hall is one of the grandest buildings on the
Continent. Its construction cost 6,000,000 dollars.
It stands five hundred and fifty feet on Larkin street,
seven hundred on McAllister street, and eight hundred
and sixty feet on Park avenue.</p>
<p>The Mint at San Francisco is the largest one in the
United States. Its architecture is Doric, and it is constructed
of freestone and California granite.</p>
<p>San Francisco is supplied with water from several
large reservoirs, having a united capacity of seventy
billion gallons. Her harbor could accommodate the
shipping of the whole world.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543">[543]</a></span></p>
<p>Her commerce is immense. The trade of the Western
Coast from Chili to Alaska is her natural heritage,
and she can justly claim a fair, large share from China,
Japan, India, Australia and the islands of the sea.</p>
<p>She has eighty-one public schools, sixty-nine clubs,
nine public libraries, one hundred and fourteen
churches, and thirty public parks and ornamental
plazas.</p>
<p>What words could more aptly describe the career of
San Francisco than those lately written by Governor
Markham?</p>
<p>"Originally San Francisco consisted of wind-swept
hills, the shifting sands of which seemed to defy either
stability or cultivation. Now those hills, graded by
pick and shovel, are gridironed by streets and railways,
and crowned with the magnificent buildings of
a populous city, or transformed by the magic of water
and patient tillage into miles of verdant park, dotted
by miniature lakes, ribboned with gravel drives,
crowded with grottoes, statuary, conservatories, and
ornamental buildings, enriched by luxuriant shrubbery
and brilliant flowers, the wonder of the tourist,
and a delight to her contented people."</p>
<p>There are larger and more populous cities in
America than San Francisco, but few more deserving
the designation of a Great City. The energies of her
people, the prodigal wealth of her territory, and her
singularly equable and temperate climate, form a sufficient
guarantee of the increasing greatness of her
future.</p>

<p>Finding my quarters at the hotel comfortable and
restful after the strain I had endured as the result of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
two hundred days of rough riding, I deferred terminating
my journey until two days later. It will
be remembered that I undertook to ride from the
Atlantic to the Pacific in the saddle, and hence my tour
would not be literally completed before I reached the
shores of the Pacific. Accordingly on the twenty-sixth
of November I remounted and rode to the Cliff House,
a romantic resort built on a rocky prominence overlooking
the ocean. From here I descended the Toll Road
to the sandy beach. A westerly breeze rolled the
breakers up to the feet of my horse, and I forthwith
walked him into the waters of the Pacific. My self-imposed
task—my journey from <span class="smcap">Ocean to Ocean
on Horseback</span>—was accomplished.</p>
