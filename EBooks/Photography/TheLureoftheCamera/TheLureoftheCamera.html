<p class="chap center">PREFACE</p>
<p><span class="sc chap1">The</span> difference between a ramble and a journey
is about the same as that between pleasure
and business. When you go anywhere for a
serious purpose, you make a journey; but if you
go for pleasure (and don’t take the pleasure too
seriously, as many do) you only ramble.</p>
<p>The sketches in this volume, which takes its
name from the first chapter, are based upon
“rambles,” which were for the most part merely
incidental excursions, made possible by various
“journeys” undertaken for more serious purposes.
It has been the practice of the author for
many years to carry a camera on his travels, so
that, if chance should take him within easy distance
of some place of literary, historic, or scenic
interest, he might not miss the opportunity to
pursue his favorite avocation.</p>
<p>If the reader is asked to make long flights, as
from Scotland to Italy, then back, across the Atlantic,
to New England, and thence overland to
Wyoming and Arizona, he must remember that
ramblers take no account of distance or direction.
In this case they must take no account of time,
for these rambles are but the chance happenings
that have occurred at intervals in a period
of more than a dozen years.</p>
<p>People who are in a hurry, and those who in
traveling seek to “do” the largest number of
places in the shortest number of days, are advised
not to travel with an amateur photographer. Not
only must he have leisure to find and study his
subjects, but he is likely to wander away from
the well-worn paths and use up his time in making
inquiries, in a fashion quite exasperating to
the tourist absorbed in his itinerary.</p>
<p>The rambles here chronicled could not possibly
be organized into an itinerary or moulded
into a guidebook. The author simply invites
those who have inclinations similar to his own,
to wander with him, away from the customary
paths of travel, and into the homes of certain distinguished
authors or the scenes of their writings,
and to visit with him various places of
historic interest or natural beauty, without a
thought of maps, distances, time-tables, or the
toil and dust of travel. This is the real essence
of rambling.<br><br></p>
<p>The chapter on “The Country of Mrs. Humphry
Ward” was published originally in <i>The
Outlook</i> in 1909, and “A Day in Wordsworth’s
Country,” in the same magazine in 1910.</p>

THE LURE OF THE CAMERA</p>

<p class="chap center">THE LURE OF THE<br>
CAMERA</p>
<p class="center">I</p>
<p class="noind"><span class="chap1 sc">Two</span> pictures, each about the size of a large
postage-stamp, are among my treasured possessions.
In the first, a curly-headed boy of two,
in a white dress, is vigorously kicking a football.
The second depicts a human wheelbarrow,
the body composed of a sturdy lad of seven,
whose two plump arms serve admirably the purpose
of a wheel, his stout legs making an excellent
pair of handles, while the motive power is
supplied by an equally robust lad of eight, who
grasps his younger brother firmly by the ankles.</p>
<p>These two photographs, taken with a camera
so small that in operation it was completely concealed
between the palms of my hands, revealed
to me for the first time the fascination of amateur
photography. The discovery meant that
whatever interested me, even if no more than
the antics of my children, might be instantly recorded.
I had no idea of artistic composition,
nor of the proper manipulation of plates, films,
and printing papers. Still less did I foresee that
the tiny little black box contained the germ of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4"></a>4</span>
an indefinable impulse, which, expanding and
growing more powerful year by year, was to lead
me into fields which I had never dreamed of exploring,
into habits of observation never before
a part of my nature, and into a knowledge of
countless places of historic and literary interest
as well as natural beauty and grandeur, which
would never have been mine but for the lure of
the camera.</p>
<p>The spell began to make itself felt almost immediately.
I determined to buy a camera of my
own,—for the two infinitesimal pictures were
taken with a borrowed instrument,—and was
soon the possessor of a much larger black box
capable of making pictures three and a quarter
inches square. The film which came with it was
quickly “shot off,” and then came the impulse to
go somewhere. My wife and I decided to spend
a day at a pretty little inland lake, a few hours’
ride from our home. I hastened to the druggist’s
to buy another film, and without waiting to insert
it in the camera, off we started. Arrived on
the scene, our first duty was to “load” the new
machine. The roll puzzled us a little. Somehow
the directions did not seem to fit. But we got it
in place finally and began to enjoy the pleasures
of photography.</p>
<p>Our first view was a general survey of the
lake, which is nearly twelve miles long, with many
bays and indentations in the shore-line, making
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5"></a>5</span>
a rather large subject for a picture only three
and a quarter inches square. But such difficulties
did not seem formidable. The directions clearly
intimated that if we would only “press the button”
somebody would “do the rest,” and we
expected the intangible somebody to perform
his part of the contract as faithfully as we were
doing ours. Years afterward, chancing to pass
by the British Museum, which stretches its huge
bulk through Great Russell Street a distance of
nearly four hundred feet, we saw a little girl
taking its picture with a “Brownie” camera.
“That reminds me of ‘Dignity and Impudence,’”
said my wife, referring to Landseer’s
well-known painting which we had seen at the
National Gallery that afternoon. This is the
mistake which all amateurs make at first—that
of expecting the little instrument to perform impossible
feats.</p>
<p>But to resume my story. We spent a remarkably
pleasant day composing beautiful views.
We shot at the bays and the rocks, at the
steamers and the sail-boats and at everything
else in sight except the huge ice-houses which
disfigure what would otherwise be one of the
prettiest lakes in America. We posed for each
other in picturesque attitudes on the rocks and
in a little rowboat which we had hired. We had
a delightful outing and only regretted when, all
too soon, the last film was exposed. But we felt
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page6"></a>6</span>
unusually happy to think that we had a wonderful
record of the day’s proceedings to show to
our family and friends.</p>
<p>That night I developed the roll, laboriously
cutting off one exposure at a time, and putting
it through the developer according to directions.
Number one was blank! Something wrong with
the shutter, I thought, and tried the next. Number
two was also blank!! What can this mean?
Perhaps I haven’t developed it long enough.
So into the fluid went another one, and this one
stayed a long time. To my dismay number three
was as vacant as the others, and so were all the
rest of the twelve. Early the next morning I was
at the drug store demanding an explanation.
The druggist confessed that the film-roll he had
sold me was intended for another camera, but
“It ought to have worked on yours,” he said.
Subsequent investigation proved that on my
camera the film was to be inserted on the left,
while on the other kind it went in on the right.
This difference seemed insignificant until I discovered
that in turning the roll to insert it on
the opposite side from what was intended, I had
brought the strip of black paper to the front of
the film, thus preventing any exposure at all!
Thus I learned the first principle of amateur
photography:—<i>Know exactly what you are
doing</i> and take no chances with your apparatus.
A young lady, to whom I once attempted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page7"></a>7</span>
to explain the use of the various “stops” on
her camera, impatiently interrupted me with the
remark, “Well, that’s the way it was set when I
got it and I’m not going to bother to change it.
If the pictures are no good, I’ll send it back.”
It is such people who continually complain of
“bad luck” with their films.</p>
<p>It was two or three years after the complete
failure of my first expedition before the camera
again exerted its spell, except that meanwhile it
was faithfully recording various performances of
the family, especially in the vacation season. It
was in the autumn of 1898. The victorious
American fleet had returned from Santiago and
all the famous battleships and cruisers were triumphantly
floating their ensigns in the breezes
of New York Harbor. “Here is a rare opportunity.
Come!” said the camera. Taking passage
on a steamer, I found a quiet spot by the lifeboats,
outside the rail, where the view would be
unobstructed. We passed in succession all the
vessels, from the doughty Texas, commanded by
the lamented Captain Philip, to the proud Oregon,
with the laurels of her long cruise around
Cape Horn to join in the fight. One by one I
photographed them all. Here, at last, I thought,
are some pictures worth while. I had been in the
habit of doing my own developing—with indifferent
success, it must be confessed. These exposures,
made under ideal conditions, were too
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8"></a>8</span>
precious to be risked, so I took the roll to a
prominent firm of dealers in photographic goods,
for developing and printing. Every one was
spoiled! Not a good print could be found in the
lot. Impure chemicals and careless handling had
left yellow spots and finger-marks on every negative!
Subsequent investigation revealed the fact
that a negro janitor had been entrusted with
the work. Here, then, was maxim number two
for the amateur—<i>Do your own developing</i>,
and be sure to master the details of the operation.
The old adage, “If you want a thing well
done, do it yourself,” applies with peculiar force
to photography.</p>
<p>Another experience, which happened soon
after, came near ending forever all further attempts
in photography. This time I lost, not
only the negatives, but the camera itself. Having
accomplished very little, I resolved to try no
more. But a year or two later a friend offered
to sell me his 4 × 5 plate camera, with tripod,
focusing-cloth and all, at a ridiculously low
price, and enough of the old fever remained to
make me an easy—victim, shall I say? No!
How can I ever thank him enough? I put my
head under the focusing-cloth and for the first
time looked at the inverted image of a beautiful
landscape, reflected in all its colors upon the
ground glass. At that moment began my real
experience in photography. The hand camera is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9"></a>9</span>
only a toy. A child can use it as well as an expert.
It has its limitations like the stone walls of
a prison yard, and beyond them one cannot go.
All is guesswork. Luck is the biggest factor of
success. Artistic work is practically impossible.
It is not until you begin to compose your pictures
on the ground glass that art in photography
becomes a real thing. Then it is amazing
to see how many variations of the same scene
may be obtained, how many different effects of
light and shade, and how much depends upon
the point of view. Then, too, one becomes more
independent of the weather, for by a proper use
of the “stop” and careful application of the
principles of correct exposure, it is possible to
overcome many adverse conditions.</p>
<p>An acquaintance once expressed surprise that
I was willing to spend day after day of my vacation
walking about with a heavy camera case,
full of plate-holders in one hand, and a bulky
tripod slung over my shoulder. I replied that it
was no heavier than a bagful of golf-sticks, that
the walk took me through an endless variety of
beautiful scenery, and that the game itself was
fascinating. Of course, my friend could not appreciate
my point of view, for he had never
paused on the shore of some sparkling lake to
study the ripple of the waters, the varying shades
of green in the trees of the nearest bank, the

in the sun, but looking cooler and darker where
seen through the transparent cover of the shallow
water, the deep purple of the undulating hills in
the distance, and above it all the canopy of filmy,
foamy cumulus clouds, with flat bases and rounded
outlines, and here and there a glimpse of the
loveliest cerulean blue. He had never looked upon
such scenes as these with the exhilarating thought
that something of the marvelous beauty which
nature daily spreads before us can be captured
and taken home as a permanent reminder of
what we have seen.</p>
<p>To catch the charm of such a scene is no child’s
play. It requires the use of the best of lenses and
other appliances, skill derivable only from long
study and experience, and a natural appreciation
of the artistic point of view. It requires even
more, for the plate must be developed and the
prints made, both operations calling for skill and
a sense of the artistic.</p>
<p>The underlying pleasure in nearly all sports and
in many forms of recreation is the overcoming of
obstacles. The football team must defeat a heavy
opposing force to gain any sense of satisfaction.
If the opponents are “easy,” there is no fun in
the game. The hunter who incurs no hardship
complains that the sport is tame. A fisherman
would rather land one big black bass after a long
struggle than catch a hundred perch which almost
jump into your boat without an invitation.</p>

<p>Photography as a sport possesses this element
in perfection. Those who love danger may find
plenty of it in taking snap-shots of charging
rhinoceroses, or flash-light pictures of lions and
tigers in the jungle. Those who like hunting may
find more genuine enjoyment in stalking deer for
the purpose of taking the animal’s picture than
they would get if they took his life. Those who
care only to hunt landscapes—and in this class
I include myself—can find all the sport they
want in the less strenuous pursuit. There is not
only the exhilaration of searching out the attractive
scenes,—the rugged mountain-peak; the
woodland brook; the shady lane, with perhaps a
border of white birches; the ruined castle; the
seaside cliffs; the well-concealed cascade; or the
scene of some noteworthy historical event,—but
the art of photography itself presents its own
problems at every turn. To solve all these; to
select the right point of view; to secure an artistic
“balance” in all parts of the picture; to avoid
the ugly things that sometimes persist in getting
in the way; to make due allowance for the effect
of wind or motion; to catch the full beauty of
the drifting clouds; to obtain the desired transparency
in the shadows,—these and a hundred
other considerations give sufficient exercise to the
most alert mind and add to the never-ending
fascination of the game.</p>
<p>I have noticed that the camera does not lure
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12"></a>12</span>
one into the beaten tracks which tourists most
frequent. It is helpless on the top of a crowded
coach or in a swiftly flying motor-car. It gets
nervous when too many people are around, especially
if they are in a hurry, and fails to do its
work. It must be allowed to choose its own paths
and to proceed with leisure and calmness. It is
a charming guide to follow. I have always felt
a sense of relief when able to escape the interminable
jargon of the professional guides who
conduct tourists through the various show places
of Europe, and so far as it has been my fortune
to visit such places, have usually left with a vague
feeling of disappointment. On the other hand,
when, acting under the spell of the camera, I have
sought an acquaintance with the owner of some
famous house and have proceeded at leisure to
photograph the rooms and objects of interest, I
have left not only with a sense of complete satisfaction,
but with a new friendship to add to the
pleasure of future memories.</p>

<p>To visit the places made famous by their associations

like the mountain-peaks of Switzerland

LITERARY RAMBLES IN GREAT BRITAIN</p>
<p class="center">I</p>
<p class="noind"><span class="chap1 sc">Emerson</span> said of the English people, “Every
one of these islanders is an island himself,
safe, tranquil, incommunicable,” and that “It is
almost an affront to look a man in the face without
being introduced.” Holmes, on the contrary, records
that he and his daughter were “received
with nothing but the most overflowing hospitality
and the most considerate kindness.” Lowell
found the average Briton likely to regard himself
as “the only real thing in a wilderness of shams,”
and thought his patronage “divertingly insufferable.”
On the other hand, he praised the genuineness
of the better men of England, as “so
manly-tender, so brave, so true, so warranted to
wear, they make us proud to feel that blood is
thicker than water.” Longfellow met at dinner
on two successive days what he called “the two
opposite poles of English character.” One of
them was “taciturn, reserved, fastidious” and
without “power of enjoyment”; the other was
“expansive, hilarious, talking incessantly, laughing
loud and long.” All of this suggests that in
attempting to write one’s impressions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page18"></a>18</span>
English or any other people, one must remember,
what I once heard a Western schoolmaster declare
with great emphasis—“some people are
not all alike!”</p>
<p>I have but one impression to record, namely,
that, almost without exception, the people whom
we met, both in England and Scotland, manifested
a spirit of helpfulness that made our photographic
work delightful and led to the accomplishment
of results not otherwise obtainable.
They not only showed an unexpected interest in
our work, but seemed to feel some sense of obligation
to assist. This was true even of the policeman
at the gate of the Tower of London, who,
according to his orders, deprived me of my camera
before I could enter. But upon my protesting,
he referred me to another guardian of the place,
and he to another, until, continuing to pass
“higher up,” I was at last photographing everything
of interest, including the “Beef-Eater”
who obligingly carried my case of plates. Whenever
difficulties arose, these helpful people always
seemed ready with suggestions. It seemed to be
more than courtesy. It was rather a friendly sympathy,
a desire that I might have what I came
for, and a kind of personal anxiety that I should
not be disappointed.</p>
<p>An incident which happened at the very outset
of our photographic experiences in England,
and one which was responsible in large measure
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page19"></a>19</span>
for much of the success of that undertaking, will
serve as an example of the genial and sympathetic
spirit which seemed to be everywhere
prevalent. We had started to discover and to
photograph, so far as possible, the scenes of
George Eliot’s writings, and on the day of our
arrival in London, my wife had found in the
British Museum a particularly interesting portrait
of George Henry Lewes. She learned that
permission to copy it must be obtained from the
Keeper of the Prints, and accordingly, on the
following morning I appeared in the great room
of the Museum where thousands of rare prints
are carefully preserved.</p>
<p>Sir Sidney Colvin, the distinguished biographer
of Robert Louis Stevenson, and the head of
this department, was not in, but a polite assistant
made note of my name and message, making
at the same time an appointment for the next day.
At the precise hour named I was present again,
revolving in my mind the briefest possible method
of requesting permission to copy the Lewes picture.
Presently I was informed that Mr. Colvin
wished to see me, and I followed the guide, mechanically
repeating to myself the little formula
or speech I intended to make, and wondering
what luck I should have. The formula disappeared
instantly as a pleasant-faced gentleman advanced
with outstretched hand and genial smile,
calling me by name and saying, “I have something
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page20"></a>20</span>
I want to show you, if you would care to
see it.” Considerably surprised, I saw him touch
a button as he resumed,—“It’s a picture of
George Eliot,—at least we think it is, but we
are not sure,—we bought it from the executor
of the estate of Sir Frederic Burton, the artist.”
Here the attendant appeared and was instructed
to get the portrait. It proved to be a large painting
in water-colors of a woman’s face, with remarkably
strong, almost masculine features and
a pair of eyes that seemed to say, “If any woman
in the world can do a man’s thinking, I’m that
person.” A letter received subsequently, in answer
to my inquiry, from Sir Theodore Martin,
who was a lifelong friend of the novelist as well
as the painter, definitely established the fact that
the newly discovered portrait was a “study” for
the authorized portrait which Sir Frederic Burton
painted. No doubt the artist came to realize more
of the true womanliness of George Eliot’s character,
for he certainly softened the expression of
those determined-looking eyes.</p>
<p>After we had discussed the picture at some
length, my new-found friend inquired about my
plans. I told him I meant to visit, so far as possible,
the scenes of George Eliot’s novels and to
photograph all the various places of interest.
“Of course you’ll go to Nuneaton?” he asked.
“Yes,” I replied, in a tone of assurance; “I expect
to visit Arbury Hall, the original of Cheverel
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page21"></a>21</span>
Manor.” “I suppose, then, you are acquainted
with Mr. Newdegate,” said he, inquiringly. I had
to confess that I did not know the gentleman.
Mr. Colvin looked at me in surprise. “Why, you
can’t get in if you don’t know him. Arbury is
a private estate.” This remark struck me with
stunning force. I had supposed I could go anywhere.
The game was a new one to me, and here
at the very beginning appeared to be an insurmountable
barrier. Of course, I could not expect
to walk into private houses and grounds to
make photographs, and how was I to make the
acquaintance of these people? Mr. Colvin seemed
to read my thought and promptly solved the
problem. “I happen to know Mr. Newdegate
well. He was a classmate at Oxford. I’ll give
you a letter of introduction.—No, I’ll do better.
I’ll write and tell him you’re coming.”</p>
<p>This courtesy, from a gentleman to whom I
was a complete stranger, was as welcome as it was
unexpected, and nearly caused me to forget the
original purpose of my call. But Mr. Colvin did
not forget. As I was about to leave, he asked if
I wished a copy of the Eliot portrait and added,
“Of course, you will have permission to copy the
Lewes picture”; and the interview ended with
his promise to have the official photographer
make me copies of both. I returned to the hotel to
report that the Lewes picture had been obtained
without even asking for it, and the next morning
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page22"></a>22</span>
received a message from the owner of Arbury
Hall cordially inviting us to visit him.</p>
<p>Of Arbury itself I knew little, but I had read,
somewhere, that the full-length portraits of Sir
Christopher Cheverel and his lady by Sir Joshua
Reynolds, which George Eliot describes as hanging
side by side in the great saloon of Cheverel
Manor, might still be seen at Arbury. I was,
therefore, eager to find them.</p>
<p>We lost no time in proceeding to Nuneaton,
where we passed the night at the veritable tavern
which was the scene of Lawyer Dempster’s conviviality.
Readers of “Janet’s Repentance” will
recall that the great “man of deeds” addressed
the mob in the street from an upper window of
the “Red Lion,” protesting against the “temptation
to vice” involved in the proposition to
hold Sunday evening lectures in the church. He
brought the meeting to a close by calling for
“Three cheers for True Religion”; then retiring
with a party of friends to the parlor of the inn,
he caused “the most capacious punch-bowl” to
be brought out and continued the festivities until
after midnight, “when several friends of sound
religion were conveyed home with some difficulty,
one of them showing a dogged determination to
seat himself in the gutter.”</p>

<tr><td class="caption">THE GRAND SALOON, ARBURY HALL</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The old tavern, one of the few which still retain
the old-fashioned arched doorways through
which the coaches used to enter to change horses,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page23"></a>23</span>
boasts of having entertained guests no less distinguished
than Oliver Cromwell and the immortal
Shakespeare. My wife said she was sure this was
true, for the house smelled as if it had not been
swept since Shakespeare’s time.</p>
<p>In the morning we drove to Arbury Hall, the
private grounds of which make a beautifully
wooded park of three hundred acres. The mansion
is seen to the best advantage from the opposite
side of a little pool, where the surrounding
trees and shrubbery are pleasantly reflected in
the still water, where marsh-grass and rushes are
waving gently in the summer air, and the pond-lilies
spread their round green leaves to make
a richer, deeper background for their blossoms
of purest white. On a green knoll behind this
charming foreground stands a gray stone mansion
of rectangular shape, its sharp corners softened
with ivy and by the foliage at either end.
Three great gothic windows in the center, flanked
on both ends by slightly projecting wings, each
with a double-storied oriel, and a multitude of pinnacles
surmounting the walls on every side, give
a distinguished air to the building, as though it
were a part of some great cathedral. This Gothic
aspect was imparted to the mansion something
over a hundred years ago by Sir Roger Newdigate,
who was the prototype of George Eliot’s Sir
Christopher Cheverel, and the novelist describes
the place as if in the process of remodeling.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page24"></a>24</span></p>
<p>We were cordially welcomed by the present
owner, Mr. Newdegate, whose hospitality doubly
confirmed our first impressions of British courtesy.
After some preliminary conversation we
rose to begin a tour of inspection. Our host threw
open a door and instantly we were face to face
with the two full-length portraits of Sir Christopher
and Lady Cheverel, which for so long had
stood in my mind as the only known objects of
interest at Arbury. They are the work, by the
way, not of Sir Joshua Reynolds, but of George
Romney. George Eliot wrote from memory, probably
a full score of years after her last visit to
the place, and this is one of several slight mistakes.
These fine portraits, really representing
Sir Roger Newdigate and his lady, hang at the
end of a large and sumptuously furnished room,
with high vaulted ceiling in the richest Gothic
style, suggesting in the intricate delicacy of its
tracery the famous Chapel of Henry VII in Westminster
Abbey. The saloon, as the apartment is
called, is lighted chiefly by a large bay window, the
very one through which Sir Christopher stepped
into the room and found various members of his
household “examining the progress of the unfinished
ceiling.”</p>
<p>Looking out through these windows, our host
noticed some gathering clouds and suggested a
drive through the park before the shower. Soon
his pony-cart was at the door, drawn by a dainty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page25"></a>25</span>
little horse appropriately named “Lightheart,”
for no animal with so fond a master could possibly
have a care in the world. We stopped for a few
minutes at Astley Castle, the “Knebley Abbey”
of George Eliot, an old but picturesque mansion,
once the residence of the famous Lord Seymour
and his ill-fated protégée, Lady Jane Grey. Then,
after a brief pause at the parson’s cottage, we
proceeded to Astley Church, a stone building
with a square tower such as one sees throughout
England.</p>
<p>A flock of sheep pasturing in the inclosure
suggested George Eliot’s bucolic parson, the Reverend
Mr. Gilfil, who smoked his pipe with the
farmers and talked of “short-horns” and “sharrags” and
“yowes” during the week, and on
Sunday after Sunday repeated the same old sermons
to the ever-increasing satisfaction of his
parishioners. We photographed this ancient
temple on the inside as well as outside, for it
contains some curious frescoes representing the
saints holding ribbons with mottoes from which
one is expected to obtain excellent moral lessons.</p>
<p>Our next objective was the birthplace of
George Eliot, a small cottage standing in one
corner of the park. We were driving rapidly
along one of the smooth roads leading to the place,
when the pony made a sudden turn to the right.
I was sitting on the rear seat, facing backward,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page26"></a>26</span>
camera and tripod in hand. The cart went down
a steep embankment, then up again, and the next
instant I was sprawled ignominiously on the
ground, while near by lay the tripod, broken into
a hundred splinters. Scrambling to my feet, I
saw the pony-cart stuck tight in the mud of a
ditch not far away, my wife and our host still on
the seat, and nobody the worse for the accident
except poor Lightheart, who was almost overcome
with excitement. He had encountered some men
on the road leading a bull, and quickly resolved
not to face what, to one of his gentle breeding,
seemed a deadly peril.</p>
<p>Leading the trembling Lightheart, we walked
back to the house, and in due season sat down to
luncheon beneath the high vaulted ceiling of that
splendid dining-room, which George Eliot thought
“looked less like a place to dine in than a piece
of space inclosed simply for the sake of beautiful
outline.” A cathedral-like aspect is given to the
room by the great Gothic windows which form
the distinguishing architectural feature of the
building. These open into an alcove, large enough
in itself, but small when compared with the main
part of the room. The ecclesiastical effect is
heightened by the rich Gothic ornamentation of
the canopies built over various niches in the walls,
or rather it would be, were it not for the fact
that the latter are filled with life-size statues in
white marble, of a distinctly classical character.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page27"></a>27</span>
Opposite the windows is a mantel of generous
proportions, in pure white, the rich decorations of
which would not be inappropriate for some fine
altar-piece; but Cupid and Psyche, standing in
a carved niche above, instantly dissipate any
churchly thoughts, though they seem to be
having a heavenly time.</p>
<p>After luncheon we sat for a time in the library,
in the left wing of the building, examining a first
folio Shakespeare, while our host busied himself
with various notes of introduction and other
memoranda for our benefit. As we sat in the
oriel window of this room,—the same in which
Sir Christopher received the Widow Hartopp,—we
noticed what appeared to be magazines, fans,
and other articles on the chairs and sofas. They
proved to be embroidered in the upholstery. It
is related that Sir Roger Newdigate—“Sir Christopher
Cheverel,” it will be remembered—used
to remonstrate with his lady for leaving her belongings
scattered over his library. She—good
woman—was not only obedient, but possessed
a sense of humor as well, for she promptly removed
the articles, but later took advantage of
her lord’s absence to leave their “counterfeit
presentment” in such permanent form that there
they have remained for more than a century.</p>
<p>The opposite wing of the mansion contains
the drawing-room, adjoining the saloon. It is
lighted by an oriel window corresponding to that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page28"></a>28</span>
in the library. The walls are decorated with a
series of long narrow panels, united at the top by
intricate combinations of graceful pointed arches,
in keeping with the Gothic style of the whole
building. It was curious to note how well George
Eliot remembered it, for here was the full-length
portrait of Sir Anthony Cheverel “standing with
one arm akimbo,” exactly as described. How did
the novelist happen to remember that “arm
akimbo,” if, as is quite likely, she had not seen
the room for more than twenty years?</p>
<p>It was in this room that Catarina sat down to
the harpsichord and poured out her emotions in
the deep rich tones of a fine contralto voice. The
harpsichord upon which the real Catarina played—her
name was Sally Shilton—is now upstairs
in the long gallery, and here we saw not only
that interesting instrument, but also the “queer
old family portraits ... of faded, pink-faced
ladies, with rudimentary features and highly
developed head-dresses—of gallant gentlemen,
with high hips, high shoulders, and red pointed
beards.”</p>
<p>Mr. Newdegate, with that fine spirit of helpfulness
that we had met in his friend Mr. Colvin,
informed us that he had invited the Reverend
Frederick R. Evans, Canon of Bedworth, a
nephew of George Eliot, to meet us at luncheon,
but an engagement had interfered. We were invited,
however, to visit the rectory at Bedworth,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page29"></a>29</span>
and later did so, receiving a cordial welcome.
Mrs. Evans took great delight in showing various
mementoes of her husband’s distinguished
relative, including a lace cap worn by George
Eliot and a pipe that once belonged to the Countess
Czerlaski of “The Sad Fortune of the Reverend
Amos Barton.” I can still hear the ring
of her hearty laugh as she took us into the parlor,
and pointing to a painting on the wall, exclaimed,
“And here is Aunt Glegg!” There she was, sure
enough, with the “fuzzy front of curls” which
were always “economized” by not wearing them
until after 10.30 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> At this point the canon
suddenly asked, “Have you seen the stone table?”
I had been looking for this table. It is the one
where Mr. Casaubon sat when Dorothea found
him, apparently asleep, but really dead, as dramatically
told in “Middlemarch.” I had expected to
find it at Griff House, near Nuneaton, the home
of George Eliot’s girlhood, but the arbor at the
end of the Yew Tree Walk was empty. We were
quite pleased, therefore, when Mr. Evans took us
into his garden and there showed us the original
table of stone which the novelist had in mind
when she wrote the incident.</p>
<p>Among the other things Mr. Newdegate had
busied himself in writing, while we sat in his
library, was a message to a friend in Nuneaton,
Dr. N——, who, he said, knew more about George
Eliot than any one else in the neighborhood. We
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page30"></a>30</span>
accordingly stopped our little coupé at the doctor’s
door, as we drove back to town. He insisted
upon showing us the landmarks, and as there was
no room in our vehicle, mounted his bicycle and
told the driver to follow. In this way we were
able to identify nearly all the localities of “Amos
Barton” and “Janet’s Repentance.” He also
pointed out the schoolhouse where Mary Ann
Evans was a pupil in her eighth or ninth year.
We arrived just as school was dismissed and a
crowd of modern school children insisted upon
adding their bright rosy faces to our picture.
They looked so fresh and interesting that I made
no objection.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">A SCHOOL IN NUNEATON</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>On the next evening we were entertained by
the doctor and his wife at their home. A picture
of Nuneaton fifty years ago attracted my notice.
The doctor explained that the artist, when a
young girl, had known George Eliot’s father and
mother, and had been interested to paint various
scenes of the earlier stories. He advised us not
to call, because the old lady was very feeble. What
was my astonishment when, upon returning to
London a few weeks later, I found a letter from
this same good lady, expressing regret that she had
not met us, and stating that she was sending me
twenty-five of her water-color sketches. Among
them were sketches of John and Emma Gwyther,
the original Amos and Milly Barton, drawn from
life many years ago. Later she sent me a portrait
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page31"></a>31</span>
of Nanny, the housemaid who drove away the
bogus countess. These dear people seemed determined
to make our quest a success.</p>
<p>We now turned our attention to “Adam
Bede,” traveling into Staffordshire and Derbyshire,
where Robert Evans, the novelist’s father
and the prototype of Adam Bede, was born and
spent the years of his young manhood. Here
again we were assisted by good-natured English
people. The first was a station agent. Just as
the twilight was dissolving into a jet-black night
we alighted from the train at the little hamlet of
Norbury, with a steamer trunk, several pieces
of hand-baggage, a camera, and an assortment
of umbrellas. We expected to go to Ellastone,
two miles away, the original of Hayslope, the
home of Adam Bede, and the real home, a century
ago, of Robert Evans. After the train left,
the only person in sight was the station agent,
who looked with some surprise at the pile of
luggage.</p>
<p>In reply to our question, he recommended
walking as the best and only way to reach Ellastone.
A stroll of two miles, over an unknown
and muddy road, in inky darkness, with two or
three hundred pounds of luggage to carry, did
not appeal to us, particularly as it was now beginning
to rain. We suggested a carriage, but
there was none. Hotel? Norbury boasted no
such conveniences. It began to look as though
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page32"></a>32</span>
we might be obliged to camp out in the rain on
the station platform. But the good-natured agent,
whose day’s work was now done, and who was
anxious to go home to his supper, placed the
ticket-office, where there was a fire, at our disposal,
and a boy was found who was willing to
go to Ellastone on his bicycle and learn whether
the inn was open (the agent thought not),
and if so, whether any one there would send
a carriage for us. A long wait of an hour ensued,
during which we congratulated ourselves
that if we had to sleep on the floor of the ticket-office,
it would at least be dryer than the platform.
At last the boy returned with the news
that the inn was <i>not</i> open, but that a carriage
would be sent for us! After another seemingly
interminable delay, we finally heard the welcome
sound of wheels on the gravel. Our carriage had
arrived! It was a butcher’s cart. When the baggage
was thrown in, there was but one seat left—the
one beside the driver. Small chance for
two fairly good-sized passengers, but there was
only one solution. I climbed in and took the only
remaining seat, while my knees automatically
formed another one which my companion in
misery promptly appropriated, and away we went,
twisting and turning through a wet and muddy
lane, so dark that the only visible part of the
horse was his tail, the mud flying into our faces
from one direction and the rain from another,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page33"></a>33</span>
but happy in the hope and expectation that if
the cart did not turn over and throw us into the
hedges, we should soon find a better place for a
night’s lodging than a country railway station.</p>
<p>In due time we reached the inn, the very one
before which Mr. Casson, the landlord, stood and
invited Adam Bede to “step in an’ tek somethink.”
We were greeted with equal hospitality
by the landlord’s wife, who ushered us into the
“best parlor,” kindled a rousing fire in the grate
(English fires are not usually “rousing”), and
asked what we would have for supper. By the
time the mud had dried in nice hard lozenges on
our clothing, an excellent meal was on the table.
It disappeared with such promptness as to bring
tears of gratitude to the eyes of the cook—none
other than the hospitable landlady herself. We
then found ourselves settled for the night in a
large, airy, and particularly clean bedroom, the
best chamber in the house. “Oh, no, sir, the inn
is not open,” explained our good Samaritan, “but
we ’re always glad to make strangers comfortable.”
These words indicate the spirit of the
remark, which we comprehended because helped
by the good lady’s eyes, her smile, and her gestures.
I cannot set down the exact words for the
reasons set forth by Mr. Casson, George Eliot’s
landlord of the Donnithorne Arms, who said to
Adam: “They ’re cur’ous talkers i’ this country;
the gentry’s hard work to hunderstand ’em; I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34"></a>34</span>
was brought hup among the gentry, sir, an’ got
the turn o’ their tongue when I was a bye. Why,
what do you think the folks here says for ‘hev n’t
you’?—the gentry, you know, says, ‘hev n’t
you’—well, the people about here says, ‘hanna
yey.’ It’s what they call the dileck as is spoke
hereabout, sir.”</p>

<p>It was curious to note, when we explored the
village the next morning, that Ellastone is even
now apparently just the same little hamlet it was
in the time of George Eliot’s father. I had never
expected to find the real Hayslope. I supposed,
of course, that it would be swallowed up by
some big manufacturing town. But here it was
exactly as represented—except that Adam Bede’s
cottage has been enlarged and repainted and a
few small houses now occupy the village green
where Dinah Morris preached. The parish church,
with its square stone tower and clock of orthodox
style, still remains the chief landmark of the village
as it was on the day in 1801 when Robert
Evans married his first wife, Harriet Poynton, a
servant in the Newdigate family, by whom the
young man was also employed as a carpenter.
Mr. Francis Newdigate, the great-grandfather of
our friend at Arbury, lived in Wootton Hall and
was the original of the old squire in “Adam
Bede.” This fine old estate was the Donnithorne
Chase of the novel, and therefore we found it
worthy of a visit. We found the fine old “hoaks”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page35"></a>35</span>
there, which Mr. Casson mentioned to Adam,
and with them some equally fine elms and a profusion
of flowers, the latter tastefully arranged
about a series of broad stone terraces, stained
with age and partly covered with ivy, which gave
the place the dignified aspect of some ancient
palace of the nobility. Much to our regret the
owner was not at home, but the gardener maintained
the hitherto unbroken chain of courtesy
by showing us the beauties of the place from all
the best points of view.</p>
<p>It has not been my intention to follow in detail
the events of our exploration of the country
of George Eliot, nor to describe the many scenes
of varied interest which were gradually unfolded
to us. I have sought rather to suggest what is
likely to happen to an amateur photographer in
search of pictures, and how such a quest becomes
a real pleasure when the people one meets manifest
a genuine interest and a spirit of friendly
helpfulness such as we experienced almost invariably.</p>
<p class="center pt2">II</p>
<p>There were some occasions upon which the
chain of courtesy, to which I have previously
referred, if not actually broken, received some
dangerous strains, when great care had to be
taken lest it snap asunder. There are surly butlers
and keepers in England as elsewhere, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page36"></a>36</span>
encountered one of the species in the Lake District.
I had called at the country residence of
Captain ——, a wealthy gentleman and a member
of Parliament. The place was celebrated for
its wonderful gardens and is described in one of
the novels of Mrs. Humphry Ward. His High-and-Mightiness,
the Butler, was suffering from a
severe attack of the Grouch, resulting in a stiffening
of the muscles of the back and shoulders.
He would do nothing except inform me that his
Master was “not at ’ome.” I could only leave a
message and say I would return. The next day
I was greeted by the same Resplendent Person,
his visage suffused with smiles and his spinal
column oscillating like an inverted pendulum.
“Captain —— is ex-<i>treme</i>-ly sorry he cawnt
meet you, sir. He’s <i>obliged</i> to be in Lunnun to-day,
sir, but he <i>towld</i> me to <i>sai</i> to you, sir, that
you’re to <i>taik</i> everythink in the ’ouse you <i>want</i>,
sir.” And then the Important One gave me full
possession while I photographed the most interesting
rooms, coming back occasionally to inquire
whether I wished him to move “hany harticles
of furniture,” afterward hunting up the
gardener, who in turn conducted me through the
sacred precincts of his own particular domain.</p>
<p>At another time, also in connection with Mrs.
Ward’s novels, I came dangerously near to another
break. It was down in Surrey, whither we
had gone to visit the scenery of “Robert Elsmere.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page37"></a>37</span>
I knocked at the door of a little stone
cottage celebrated in the novel, and was shown
into the presence of a very old gentleman, who
looked suspiciously, first at my card, and then at
me, finally demanding to know what I wanted.
I explained that I was an American and had come
to take a picture of his house. He looked puzzled,
and after some further scrutiny of my face, my
clothes, my shoes, and my hat, said slowly, “Well,
you people in America must be crazy to come all
the way over here to photograph this house. I
have always said it’s the ugliest house in England,
owned by the ugliest landlord that ever
lived, and occupied by the ugliest tenant in the
parish.” Fortunately he was not possessed of the
Oriental delusion that a photograph causes some
of the virtue of an individual (or of a house)
to pass out into the picture, and upon further
reflection concluded that if a harmless lunatic
wanted to make a picture of his ugly old house,
it wouldn’t matter much after all.</p>
<p>Not infrequently it happened that the keepers
in charge of certain places of public interest,
while desiring to be courteous themselves, were
bound by strict instructions from their superiors.
In the year when we were exploring the length
and breadth of England and Scotland in search
of the scenes of Sir Walter Scott’s writings, we
came one day to a famous hall, generously thrown
open to the public by the Duke of ——, who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page38"></a>38</span>
owned it. Here we found a rule that the use of
“stands” or tripods would not be permitted in
the building. Snap-shots with hand-cameras were
freely allowed, but these are always more or less
dependent on chance, and for interior views, requiring
a long time-exposure, are worthless. The
duke, apparently, did not mind poor pictures, but
was afraid of good ones. I felt that I really must
have views of the famous rooms of that house,
and we pleaded earnestly with the keeper. But
orders were orders and he remained inflexible,
but always courteous. He wanted to help, however,
and finally conducted me to a cottage near
by where I was presented to his immediate superior,
a good-looking and good-natured woman.
She, too, was willing and even anxious to oblige,
but the duke’s orders were imperative. Finally a
thought struck me. “You say stands are forbidden—would
it be an infraction of the rules if I
were to rest my camera on a table or chair?”
“Oh, no, indeed!” she quickly replied; then,
calling to the keeper, said, “John, I want you to
do everything you can for this gentleman.” John
seemed pleased. He first performed his duty to
the duke by locking up the dangerous tripod
where it could do no harm. Then taking charge of
us, he conducted us through the well-worn rooms,
meanwhile instructing his daughter to look after
other visitors and keep them out of our way. I
rested my camera on ancient chairs and tables so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page39"></a>39</span>
precious that the visitors were not permitted to
touch them, John kindly removing the protecting
ropes. We were taken to parts of the house and
garden not usually shown to visitors, so anxious
was our guide to assist in our purpose. At last we
came to a great ballroom, with richly carved woodwork,
but absolutely bare of furniture. Here the
forbidden “stand” was sorely needed. My companion
promptly came to the rescue. “I’ll be the
tripod,” said she. The hint was a good one, so,
resting the camera upon her shoulder, I soon had
my picture composed and in focus. Then, placing
the camera on a convenient window-ledge just
above my head, and making allowance for the
increased elevation, I gave the plate a long exposure
and the result was as good an “interior”
as I ever made.</p>
<p>This is one of the best parts of the game—the
overcoming of obstacles. Without it, photography
would be poor fun, something like the
game of checkers I once played with a village
rustic. He swept off all my men in half a dozen
moves and then went away disgusted. I was too
easy. A picture that is not worth taking a little
trouble to get is usually not worth having. I
have even been known to take pictures I really
did not need, just because some unexpected difficulties
arose.</p>
<p>Another part of the pursuit, which I have
always enjoyed, is the quiet amusement one can
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page40"></a>40</span>
often derive from unexpected situations. One day
in London, when the streets were pretty well
crowded with Coronation visitors, we decided to
take a picture of the new Victoria Monument in
front of Buckingham Palace. I had taken the precaution
to secure a permit, so, without asking any
questions, proceeded to spread out my tripod and
compose my picture. Just as I inserted the plate-holder,
a “Bobby,” by which name the London
policeman is generally known, appeared, advancing
with an air that plainly said, “I’ll soon stop
<i>that</i> game, my fine fellow!” I expressed my surprise
and said I had a permit, at the same time
drawing the slide—an action which, not being
a photographer, he did not consider significant.
He looked scornfully at the permit, and said it
was not good after 10 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> Here, again, the assistant
photographer of our expedition came to
the rescue. She exercised the woman’s privilege
of asking “Why?” and “Bobby” moved from in
front of the camera to explain. “Click” went the
shutter, in went the slide, out came the plate-holder,
and into the case went the camera. “Bobby”
politely apologized for interfering, and expressed
his deep regret at being obliged to disappoint
us. I solemnly assured him that it was all right,
that he had only done his duty and that I did not
blame him in the least! But I neglected to inform
him that the Victoria Monument was already mine.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">THE BIRTHPLACE OF ROBERT BURNS</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>One of the pleasures of rambling with a camera
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page41"></a>41</span>
is that it takes you to so many out-of-the-way
places, which you would not otherwise be likely
to visit. Dorothy Wordsworth in her “Recollections
of a Tour in Scotland” complains that all
the roads and taverns in Scotland are bad. Dorothy
ought to have known, for she and William
walked most of the way to save their bones from
dislocation by the jolting of their little cart, and
their limited resources compelled them to seek
the shelter and food of the poorest inns. The
modern tourist, on the contrary, will find excellent
roads and for the most part hotel accommodations
where he can be fairly comfortable. It
was something of a rarity, therefore, when, as
occasionally happened, we could find nothing but
an inn of the kind that flourished a century ago.</p>
<p>On a very rainy morning in May we alighted
from the train at the little village of Ecclefechan,
known to the world only as the birthplace of
Thomas Carlyle. A farmer at the station, of whom
we inquired the location of a good hotel, answered
in a Scotch dialect so broad that we could not
compass it. By chance a carriage stood near by,
and as it afforded the only escape from the pouring
rain, we stepped in and trusted to luck. The
vehicle presently drew up before the door of a
very ancient hotel, from which the landlady,
whom we have ever since called “Mrs. Ecclefechan,”
came out to meet us. She was a frail
little woman, well along in years, with thin features,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page42"></a>42</span>
sharp eyes, and a bald head, the last of
which she endeavored to conceal beneath a sort
of peaked black bonnet, tied with strings beneath
her chin, and suggesting the rather curious
spectacle of a bishop’s miter above a female face.
Her dress was looped up by pinning the bottom
of it around her waist, exposing a gray-and-white
striped petticoat that came down halfway between
the knees and the ankles, beneath which were a
pair of coarse woolen stockings and some heavy
shoes. A burlap apron completed the costume.</p>
<p>Our hostess, who seemed to be proprietor,
clerk, porter, cook, chambermaid, waitress, barmaid,
and bootblack of the establishment, was
possessed of a kind heart, and she made us as
comfortable as her limited facilities would permit.
We were taken into the public-room, a space
about twelve feet square, with a small open fire
at one end, benches around the walls and a
table occupying nearly all the remaining space.
Across a narrow passage was the kitchen, where
the landlady baked her oatmeal cake and
served the regulars who came for a “penny’orth
o’ rum” and a bit of gossip. In front was another
tiny room where were served fastidious
guests who did not care to eat in the kitchen.
At noon we sat down to a luncheon, which might
have been worse, and at five were summoned into
the little room again. We thought it curious
to serve hard boiled eggs with afternoon tea, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page43"></a>43</span>
thinking supper would soon be ready, declined
them. This proved a sad mistake for Americans
with big, healthy appetites, for the supper never
came. The eggs were it.</p>
<p>We spent the evening in the public-room sitting
near the fire. One by one the villagers
dropped in, each man ordering his toddy and
spending an hour or two over a very small glass.
The evenings had been spent in that way in that
place for a hundred years. We seemed to be in
the atmosphere of “long ago.” A middle-aged
Scotchman, whose name was pronounced, very
broadly, “Fronk,” seemed to feel the responsibility
of entertaining us. He sang, very sweetly
I thought, a song by Lady Nairne, “The Auld
Hoose,” and recited with fine appreciation the
lines of Burns’s “Lament for James, Earl of
Glencairn,” “To a Mouse,” “To a Louse,” and
other poems. He related how Burns once helped
a friend out of a dilemma. Three women had
been buried side by side. The son of one of them
wished to put an inscription on his mother’s tombstone,
but the sexton could not remember which
grave was hers. Burns solved the problem by
suggesting these lines:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“Here, or there, or thereaboots,</p>
<p class="i2">Lies the body of Janet Coutts,</p>
<p class="i05">But here, or there, or whereaboots,</p>
<p class="i2">Nane can tell</p>
<p class="i05">Till Janet rises and tells hersel.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page44"></a>44</span></p>
<p class="noind">Our landlady assured us that Fronk “had the
bluid o’ Douglas in his veins,” but he was now
only a poor “ne’er-do-weel,” picking up “a bit
shillin’” now and then. But he loved Bobbie
Burns.</p>
<p>After the evening’s entertainment we were
shown to a tiny bedroom. Over the horrors upstairs
I must draw the veil of charity, only remarking
that if I ever go to Ecclefechan again I
shall seek out a nice soft pile of old scrap-iron
for a couch, rather than risk another night on
one of those beds.</p>
<p>Of course we visited the birthplace of Carlyle,
which is now one of the “restored” show places,
and an interesting one. We also went to the
graveyard to see the tomb of Carlyle. Here we
were conducted by an old woman, nearly ninety
years of age, very poor and feeble, who had lived
in the village all her days. We asked if she had
ever seen Carlyle. “Oh, yes,” she replied, wearily,
“I hae seen ’im. He was a coo-rious mon.”
Then brightening she added, with a smile that
revealed her heart of hearts, “But we a’ <i>love</i>
Bobbie Burns.” And so we found it throughout
Scotland. The feeble old woman and the dissipated
wanderer shared with the intelligent and
cultivated classes a deep-seated and genuine love
for their own peasant poet, whom they invariably
called, affectionately, “Bobbie.”</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">THE BURNS MONUMENT, AYRSHIRE</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>It was not long after this that we had occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page45"></a>45</span>
to visit the land of Burns, for a trip through
Scotland, even when undertaken primarily for
the sake of Scott landmarks, as ours was, would
scarcely be possible without many glimpses of the
places made famous by the elder and less cultured
but not less beloved poet. Scott’s intimacy with
Adam Ferguson, the son of the distinguished Dr.
Adam Ferguson, was the means of his introduction
to the best literary society in Edinburgh, and it
was at the house of the latter, that Scott, then a
boy of fifteen, met Burns for the first and only
time. He attracted the notice of the elder poet
by promptly naming the author of a poem which
Burns had quoted, when no one else in the room
could give the information. It is a far cry from
the aristocratic quarters of Dr. Ferguson to the
tavern in the Canongate where the “Crochallan
Fencibles” used to meet, but here the lines
crossed again, for to this resort for convivial
souls Burns came to enjoy the bacchanalian revels
known as “High Jinks,” in the same way
as did Andrew Crosbie, the original of Scott’s
fictitious Paulus Pleydell.</p>
<p>We went to the old town of Dumfries to see a
number of places described by Scott in “Guy
Mannering,” “Redgauntlet,” and other novels,
and found ourselves in the very heart of the
Burns country. In the center of High Street
stands the old Midsteeple in one room of which
the original Effie Deans, whose real name was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page46"></a>46</span>
Isabel Walker, was tried for child murder. Here
the real Jeanie Deans refused to tell a lie to save
her sister’s life, afterward walking to London to
secure her pardon. Almost around the corner is
the house where Burns’s Jean lived, and where
“Bobbie” died. In the same town is the churchyard
of St. Michaels where Burns lies buried in
a handsome “muselum,” as one of the natives
informed us.</p>
<p>Out on the road toward the old church of
Kirkpatrick Irongray, where Scott erected a monument
to Helen Walker, the prototype of Jeanie
Deans, is a small remnant of the house once occupied
by that heroine. In the same general
direction but a little farther to the north, on the
banks of the river Nith, is Ellisland, where Burns
attempted to manage a farm, attend to the duties
of an excise officer, and write poetry, all at
the same time. Out of the last came “Tam
o’ Shanter,” but the other two “attempts” were
failures.</p>
<p>We traveled down to Ayrshire to see the coast
of Carrick and what is left of the ancestral home
of Robert Bruce, where the Scottish hero landed,
with the guidance of supernatural fires, as graphically
related by Scott in “The Lord of the Isles.”
Here again we were in Burns’s own country. In
the city of Ayr we saw the “Twa Brigs” and
the very tavern which Tam o’ Shanter may be
supposed to have frequented,—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page47"></a>47</span></p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“And at his elbow, Souter Johnie,</p>
<p class="i05">His ancient, trusty, drouthy cronie.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p class="noind">Of course we drove to Burns’s birthplace, about
three miles to the south, a long, narrow cottage
with a thatched roof, one end of which was
dwelling-house and the other end stable. It was
built by the poet’s father, with his own hands,
and when Robert was born there in the winter
of 1759 probably looked a great deal less respectable
than it does now.</p>
<p>Continuing southward, we stopped at Alloway
Kirk for a view of the old church where Tam
o’ Shanter first saw the midnight dancing of the
witches and started on his famous ride. The
keeper felt personally aggrieved because I preferred
to utilize my limited time to make a picture
of the church, rather than listen to his repetition
of a tale which I already knew by heart. We
traveled over Tam’s route and soon had a fine
view of the old “Brig o’ Doon,” where Tam at
length escaped the witches at the expense of his
poor nag’s tail. I have made few pictures that
pleased me more than that of the “auld brig,”
which I was able to get by placing my camera on
the new bridge near by. Here the memory of
Burns is again accentuated by a graceful memorial,
in the form of a Grecian temple and very
similar to the one on Calton Hill, Edinburgh,
but far more beautifully situated. It is surrounded
by a garden of well-trimmed yews, shrubbery of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page48"></a>48</span>
various kinds, and a wealth of brightly blooming
flowers, and best of all, stands well above the
“banks and braes o’ bonnie Doon,” where the
poet himself would have been happy to stand and
look upon his beloved river.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been “Bobbie’s” faults,
and, poor fellow, they were many and grievous,
there is nothing more beautiful than the mantle
of love beneath which they have been concealed
and forgotten. He touched the hearts of his
countrymen as none other ever did, and out of
the sordid earth of his shortcomings have sprung
beautiful flowers, laid out along well-ordered and
graceful paths, a delight and solace to his fellow-men,
like the brilliant blossoms that brighten the
lovely garden at the base of his memorial overlooking
the Doon.</p>

A DAY IN WORDSWORTH’S COUNTRY</p>
<p class="noind"><span class="chap1 sc">Our</span> arrival on Saturday evening at the village
of Windermere was like the sudden
and unexpected realization of a dream. On many
a winter night, under the light of our library
lamp at home, we had talked of that vague, distant
“sometime” when we should visit the English
Lakes. And now—by what curious combination
of circumstances we did not try to analyze—here
we were with the whole beautiful panorama,
in all its evening splendors, spread out before
us. Through our minds passed, as in a vision, the
whole company of poets who are inseparably associated
with these scenes: Wordsworth, whose
abiding influence upon the spirit of poetry will
endure as long as the mountains and vales which
taught him to love and reverence nature; Southey,
who, himself without the appreciation of nature,
was the first to recognize Wordsworth’s
rare power of interpreting her true meaning;
Coleridge, the most intimate friend of the
greater poet, whom Wordsworth declared to be
the most wonderful man he ever met, and who,
in spite of those shortcomings which caused
his life to end in worldly failure, nevertheless
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page52"></a>52</span>
possessed a native eloquence and alluring personality.</p>
<p>Nor should we forget De Quincey, who spent
twenty of the happiest years of his life at Dove
Cottage, as the successor of the Wordsworths.
His most intimate companion was the famous
Professor Wilson of Edinburgh, known to all
readers of “Blackwood’s Magazine” as “Christopher
North.” Attracted partly by the beauty of
the Lake Country, but more by his desire to cultivate
the intimacy of Wordsworth, whose genius
he greatly admired, Professor Wilson bought a
pretty place in Cumberland, where he lived for
several years. He enjoyed the companionship of
the friendly group of poets, but, we are told, occasionally
sought a different kind of pleasure in
measuring his strength with some of the native
wrestlers, one of the most famous of whom has
testified that he found him “a very bad un to
lick.”</p>
<p>At a later time, Dr. Arnold of Rugby found
himself drawn to the Lakes by the same double
attraction, and built the charming cottage at Fox
How on the River Rothay, where his youngest
daughter still resides. He wrote in 1832: “Our
intercourse with the Wordsworths was one of the
brightest spots of all; nothing could exceed their
friendliness, and my almost daily walks with him
were things not to be forgotten.”</p>
<p>It was not alone the beauty of the Westmoreland
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page53"></a>53</span>
scenery that had attracted this group of
famous men. There are lovelier lakes in Scotland
and more majestic mountains in Switzerland.
But Wordsworth was here, in the midst of those
charming displays of Nature in her most cheerful
as well as most soothing moods. Nature’s
best interpreter and Nature herself could be seen
together. For a hundred years this same influence
has continued to exercise its spell upon travelers,
and we are bound to recognize the fact that
this, and nothing else, had drawn us away from our
prearranged path, that we might enjoy the pleasure
of a Sunday in the country of Wordsworth.</p>
<p>The morning dawned, bright and beautiful,
suggesting that splendid day when Wordsworth,
then a youth of eighteen, found himself possessed
of an irresistible desire to devote his life to poetry:</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p>The morning rose, in memorable pomp,</p>
<p>Glorious as e’er I had beheld—in front,</p>

<p>The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,</p>
<p>Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light;</p>
<p>And in the meadows and the lower grounds</p>
<p>Was all the sweetness of a common dawn—</p>
<p>Dews, vapors, and the melody of birds,</p>
<p>And laborers going forth to till the fields.</p>
<p>Ah! need I say, dear Friend, that to the brim</p>
<p>My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows</p>
<p>Were then made for me; bond unknown to me</p>
<p>Was given, that I should be, else sinning greatly,</p>
<p>A dedicated spirit.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page54"></a>54</span></p>
<p>We resolved that the whole of this beautiful
day should be devoted to catching something of
that indefinable spirit of the Westmoreland hills
which had made a poet of Wordsworth, and
through him taught the love of Nature to countless
thousands. A few steps took us away from
the town, the inn, and the other tourists, into a
quiet woodland path leading toward the lake, at
the end of which we stood</p>
<p class="center ptb1 f90">“On long Winander’s eastern shore.”</p>
<p class="noind">“Winander” is the old form of Windermere.
The lake was the scene of many of Wordsworth’s
boyhood experiences.</p>

<p>Wordsworth’s boyhood was probably very
much like that of other boys. He tells us that he
was “stiff, moody, and of a violent temper”—so
much so that he went up into his grandfather’s
attic one day, while under the resentment of
some indignity, determined to destroy himself.
But his heart failed. On another occasion he relates
that while at his grandfather’s house in
Penrith, he and his eldest brother Richard were
whipping tops in the large drawing-room. “The
walls were hung round with family pictures, and
I said to my brother, ‘Dare you strike your whip
through that old lady’s petticoat?’ He replied,
’No, I won’t.’ ‘Then,’ said I, ‘here goes!’ and
I struck my lash through her hooped petticoat;
for which, no doubt, though I have forgotten it,
I was properly punished. But, possibly from some
want of judgment in the punishments inflicted,
I had become perverse and obstinate in defying
chastisement, and rather proud of it than otherwise.”
Lowell remarks upon this incident: “Just
so do we find him afterward striking his defiant
lash through the hooped petticoat of the artificial
style of poetry, and proudly unsubdued by
the punishment of the Reviewers.” When scarcely
ten years old, it was his joy</p>
<p class="center ptb1 f90">“To range the open heights where woodcocks run.”</p>
<p class="noind">He would spend half the night “scudding away
from snare to snare,” sometimes yielding to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page56"></a>56</span>
temptation to take the birds caught in the snare of
some other lad. He felt the average boy’s terror
inspired by a guilty conscience, for he says:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p class="i3">“And when the deed was done,</p>
<p>I heard among the solitary hills</p>

</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p class="noind">Across the lake from where we stood, and over
beyond the hills on the other side, is the quaint
old town of Hawkshead, where Wordsworth was
sent to school at the age of nine years. The little
schoolhouse may still be seen, but it is of small
import. The real scenes of Wordsworth’s early
education were the woods and vales, the solitary
cliffs, the rocks and pools, and the Lake of
Esthwaite, five miles round, which he was fond
of encircling in his early morning walks, that he
might sit</p>

<p class="i10">“A swarm</p>

<p class="noind">all seemed for a time to conspire to lure his mind
away from the paths of “books and nature,”
which he would have preferred. But, curiously
enough, it was after one of these nights of revelry
that, on his way home, Wordsworth was so
much impressed with the beauties of the dawn
that he felt the impulse, previously mentioned,
to devote himself to poetry.</p>
<p>No other poet ever gave such an account of the
development of his own mind as Wordsworth
gives in the “Prelude.” And while he recounts
enough incidents like the snaring of woodcock,
the fishing for trout in the quiet pools and the
cascades of the mountain brooks, the flying of
kites on the hilltops, the nutting expeditions, the
rowing on the lake, and in the winter-time the
skating and dancing, to convince us that he was
really a boy, yet he continually shows that beneath
it all there was a deeper feeling—a prophecy
of the man who was even then developing.
No ordinary boy would have been conscious of
“a sense of pain” at beholding the mutilated
hazel boughs which he had broken in his search
for nuts. No ordinary lad of ten would be

<p>The secret of Wordsworth’s power lay in the
fact that, throughout a long life, nature was to
him a vital, living Presence—one capable of uplifting

noble truths, and at the same time providing
tranquillity and rest to the soul. As a boy he had

<p>In these noble lines we reach the very summit
of Wordsworth’s intellectual power and poetic
genius.</p>
<p>We must now retrace our steps to the village
and find a carriage to take us on our journey.
For we are not like our English friends, who are
good walkers, nor do we care to emulate the pedestrian
attainments of our poet, who, De Quincey
thought, must have traversed a distance of one
hundred and seventy-five thousand to one hundred
and eighty thousand English miles. So a
comfortable landau takes us on our way, skirting
the upper margin of the lake, then winding
along the river Brathay, pausing for a moment
to view the charming little cascade of Skelwith
Force, then on again until Red Bank is reached,
overlooking the vale of Grasmere. The first
glimpse of this placid little lake, “with its one
green island,” its shores well fringed with the
budding foliage of spring, the gently undulating
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page60"></a>60</span>
hills forming as it were a graceful frame to the
mirror of the waters, in which the reflection of
the blue sky and fleecy white clouds seemed even
more beautiful than their original overhead—the
first glimpse could scarcely fail to arouse the
emotions of the most apathetic and stir up a
poetic feeling in the most unpoetic of natures.</p>
<p>To a mind like Wordsworth’s, such a scene
was an inspiration, a revelation of Nature’s charms
such as could arouse an almost ecstatic enthusiasm
in the heart of one who, all his life, had
lived amid scenes of beauty and possessed the eyes
to see them. He came here first “a roving schoolboy,”
on a “golden summer holiday,” and even
then said, with a sigh,—</p>
<p class="center ptb1 f90">“What happy fortune were it here to live!”</p>
<p class="noind">He had no thought, nor even hope, that he would
ever realize such good fortune, but only</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page61"></a>61</span></p>
<p>Many years later, in the summer of 1799,
Wordsworth and Coleridge were walking together
over the hills and valleys of Westmoreland and
Cumberland, hoping to find, each for himself, a
home where they might dwell as neighbors. Since
receiving his degree at Cambridge in 1791 Wordsworth
had wandered about in a somewhat aimless
way, living for a time in London and in France,
visiting Germany, and finally attempting to find
a home in the south of England. A small legacy
left him in 1795 had given a feeling of independence,
and his one consuming desire at this time
was to establish a home where his beloved sister
Dorothy might be with him and he could devote
his entire time to poetry.</p>
<p>A little cottage in a quiet spot just outside
the village of Grasmere attracted his eye. It had
been a public-house, and bore the sign “The
Dove and the Olive Bough.” He called it “Dove
Cottage,” and for eight years it became his home.
We found the custodian, a little old lady, in a
penny shop across the street, and she was glad to
show us through the tiny, low-ceilinged rooms.
The cottage looks best from the little garden in
the rear. The ivy and the roses soften all the
harsh angles of the eaves and convert even the
chimney-pots into things of beauty. A tangled
mass of foliage covers the small back portico and
makes a shady nook, where a little bench is invitingly
placed. A few yards up the garden walk,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page62"></a>62</span>
over stone steps put in place by Wordsworth and
Hartley Coleridge, is the rocky well, or spring,
where the poet placed “bright gowan and marsh
marigold” brought from the borders of the lake.
At the farthest end is the little summer-house, the
poet’s favorite retreat. How well he loved this
garden is shown in the poem written when he
left Grasmere to bring home his bride in 1802:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“Sweet garden orchard, eminently fair,</p>
<p class="i05">The loveliest spot that man hath ever found.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Seating ourselves in this garden, we tried to
think of the three interesting personages who had
made the place their home. Coleridge said, “His
is the happiest family I ever saw.” They had one
common object—to work together to develop a
rare poetic gift. They were poor, for Wordsworth
had only the income of a very small legacy, and
the public had not yet come to recognize his
genius; the returns from his literary work were
therefore extremely meager. They got along with
frugal living and poor clothing, but as they made
no pretensions they were never ashamed of their
poverty. Visitors came and went, and at the cost
of many little sacrifices were hospitably entertained.</p>
<p>Perhaps the world will never know how much
Wordsworth really owed to the two women of his
household. They lived together with no sign of
jealousy or distrust. The husband and brother
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page63"></a>63</span>
was the object of their untiring and sympathetic
devotion. They walked with him, read with him,
cared for him. Mrs. Wordsworth seems to have
been a plain country-woman of simple manners,
yet possessed of a graciousness and tact which
made everything in the household go smoothly.
De Quincey declared that, “without being handsome
or even comely,” she exercised “all the
practical fascination of beauty, through the mere
compensating charms of sweetness all but angelic,
of simplicity the most entire, womanly self-respect
and purity of heart speaking through all her
looks, acts, and movements.” Wordsworth was
never more sincere than when he sang,—</p>
<p class="center ptb1 f90">“She was a phantom of delight,”</p>
<p class="noind">and closed the poem with that splendid tribute
to a most excellent wife:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“A perfect woman, nobly planned,</p>
<p class="i05">To warn, to comfort, and command;</p>
<p class="i05">And yet a spirit still, and bright</p>
<p class="i05">With something of angelic light.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>He recognized her unusual poetic instinct by
giving her full credit for the best two lines in
one of his most beautiful poems, “The Daffodils”:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“They flash upon that inward eye</p>
<p class="i05">Which is the bliss of solitude.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>To the other member of that household, his
sister Dorothy, Wordsworth gave from early boyhood
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page64"></a>64</span>
the full measure of his affection. She was
his constant companion in his walks, at all hours
and in all kinds of weather. She cheerfully performed
the irksome task of writing out his verses
from dictation. Her observations of nature were
as keen as his, and the poet was indebted to
Dorothy’s notebook for many a good suggestion.
He has been most generous in his acknowledgments
of his obligation to her:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“She gave me eyes, she gave me ears,</p>
<p class="i05">And humble cares, and delicate fears,</p>
<p class="i1" style="letter-spacing: 2em;">*******</p>
<p class="i1">And love, and thought, and joy.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>In the early days when he was overwhelmed
with adverse criticism and brought almost to the
verge of despair, it was Dorothy’s helping hand
that brought him back to his own.</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“She whispered still that brightness would return;</p>
<p class="i05">She, in the midst of all, preserved me still</p>

<p>But it is De Quincey who gives the best statement
of the world’s obligation to Dorothy. Said
he:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>Whereas the intellect of Wordsworth was, by its
original tendency, too stern, too austere, too much enamored
of an ascetic harsh sublimity, she it was—the
lady who paced by his side continually through sylvan
and mountain tracks, in Highland glens, and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page65"></a>65</span>
dim recesses of German charcoal-burners—that first
couched his eye to the sense of beauty, humanized him
by the gentler charities, and engrafted, with her delicate
female touch, those graces upon the ruder growths
of nature which have since clothed the forest of his
genius with a foliage corresponding in loveliness and
beauty to the strength of its boughs and the massiveness
of its trunks.</p>
</div>
<p>Nearly all of Wordsworth’s best poetry was
written in this little cottage, or, to speak more
accurately, it was composed while he was living
here. For it was never his way to write verses
while seated at a desk, pen in hand. His study
was out of doors. He could compose a long poem
while walking, and remember it all afterward
when ready to dictate. Thousands of verses, he
said, were composed on the banks of the brook
running through Easedale, just north of Grasmere
Lake. The tall figure of the poet was a
familiar sight to farmers for miles around, as he
paced the woods or mountain paths, his head
bent down, and his lips moving with audible if
not distinguishable sounds. One of his neighbors
has left on record an impression of how he
seemed when he was “making a poem.”</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>He would set his head a bit forward, and put his
hands behind his back. And then he would start in
bumming, and it was bum, bum, bum, stop; and then
he’d set down, and git a bit o’ paper out, and write a
bit. However, his lips were always goan’ whoole time
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page66"></a>66</span>
he was upon gress<a href="#ft1" id="fa1" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">1</span></a> walk. He was a kind mon, there’s
no two words about that; and if any one was sick i’ the
place, he wad be off to see til’ ’em.</p>
</div>
<p>In personal appearance—about which, by the
way, he cared little—he was not unlike the dalesmen
about him. Nearly six feet high, he looked
strong and hardy enough to be a farmer himself.
Carlyle speaks of him as “businesslike, sedately
confident, no discourtesy, yet no anxiety about
being courteous; a fine wholesome rusticity, fresh
as his mountain breezes, sat well on the stalwart
veteran and on all he said or did.”</p>
<p>On our return from Grasmere we took the road
along the north shore of Rydal Water—a small
lake with all the characteristic beauty of this
fascinating region, and yet not so different from
hundreds of others that it would ever attract
more than passing notice. But the name of Rydal
is linked with that of Grasmere, and the two are
visited by thousands of tourists year after year.
For fifty years the shores of these two lakes and
the hills and valleys surrounding them were the
scenes of Wordsworth’s daily walks. As we passed
we heard the cuckoo—its mysterious sound
seeming to come across the lake—and as our
own thoughts were on Wordsworth, “the wandering
Voice” seemed appropriate. If we could
have heard the skylark at that moment, our sense
of satisfaction would have been quite complete,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page67"></a>67</span>
and no doubt we should have cried out, with the
poet,—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“Up with me! up with me into the clouds!</p>
<p class="i2">For thy song, Lark, is strong;</p>

<p class="i2">Singing, singing,</p>
<p class="i05">With clouds and sky about thee ringing,</p>
<p class="i2">Lift me, guide me till I find</p>
<p class="i05">That spot which seems so to thy mind.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Just north of the eastern end of the lake, beneath
the shadow of Nab Scar, is Rydal Mount,
where the poet came to live in 1813, remaining
until his death, thirty-seven years later. Increasing
prosperity enabled him to take this far more
pretentious house. It stands on a hill, a little off
the main road, and quite out of sight of the
tourists who pass through in coaches and <i>chars-à-bancs</i>.
The drivers usually jerk their thumbs
in the general direction and say, “There is
Rydal Mount,” etc., and the tourists, who have
seen only a farmhouse—not Wordsworth’s—are
left to imagine that they have seen the house
of the poet.</p>
<p>It is an old house, but some recent changes in
doors and windows give it a more modern aspect.
The unaltered portion is thickly covered with
ivy. The ground in front is well planted with a
profusion of rhododendrons. A very old stone
stairway descends from the plaza in front of the
house to a kind of mound or rather a double
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page68"></a>68</span>
mound, the smaller resting upon a larger one.
From this point the house is seen to the best advantage.
In the opposite direction is a landscape
of rare natural beauty. Far away in the distance
lies Lake Windermere glistening like a shield of
polished silver, while on the left Wansfell and on
the right Nab Scar stand guard over the valley.
In the foreground the spire of the little church
of Rydal peeps out over the trees.</p>
<p>At the right of the house is a long terrace
which formed one of Wordsworth’s favorite walks,
where he composed thousands of verses. From
here one may see both Windermere and Rydal
Water, with mountains in the distance. Passing
through the garden we came to a gate leading
to Dora’s Field. Here is the little pool where
Wordsworth and Dora put the little goldfishes,
that they might enjoy a greater liberty. Here is
the stone which Wordsworth saved from destruction
by the builders of a stone wall. A little

<p>Dora’s field is thickly covered in spring-time
with the beautiful golden daffodils, planted by

the poet himself. No sight is more fascinating at
this season than a field of these bright yellow
flowers. We Americans, who only see them
planted in gardens, cannot realize what daffodils
mean to the English eye, unless we chance to visit
England during the early spring. What Wordsworth
called a “crowd” of daffodils, growing
in thick profusion along the margin of a lake,
beneath the trees, ten thousand to be seen at a
glance, all nodding their golden heads beside the
dancing and foaming waves, is a sight well worth

<p>But now the time had come to return to Windermere,
and reluctantly we turned our backs
upon these scenes, so full of pleasant memories.
The day, however, was not yet done, for after
supper we climbed to the top of Orrest-Head, a
little hill behind the village. No more charming
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page70"></a>70</span>
spot could have been chosen in which to spend
the closing hours of this peaceful day. Far below
lay the quiet waters of the lake, only glimpses of
its long and narrow surface appearing here and
there, like “burnished mirrors” set by Nature
for the sole purpose of reflecting a magnificent
golden sky. It was “an evening of extraordinary,
splendor,” like that one which Wordsworth saw
from Rydal Mount:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p class="i05">And penetrates the glades.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>As we stood watching the splendid sunset, the
village church rang out its chimes, as if to accompany
the inspiring scene with sweet and holy
music.</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p>The shadows which had been slowly falling
upon the scene had now so far enveloped the
mountain-side that the narrow roadways and
stone fences marking the boundaries of the fields
were barely visible. Suddenly in the distance we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page71"></a>71</span>
saw a moving object, a mere speck upon the hillside.
It darted first in one direction and then
another, like some frightened being uncertain
which way to turn. Then a darker speck appeared,
and with rapid movement circled to the
rear of the whiter one, the latter moving on
ahead. Another sudden movement, and a second
white speck appeared in another spot. The black
speck as quickly moved to the rear of this second
bit of white, driving it in the same direction as
the first. The white specks then began to seem
more numerous. We tried to count—one—two—three—ten—a
dozen—perhaps even twenty.
There was but one black speck, and he seemed to
be the master of all the others, for, darting here
and there after the stragglers, he kept them all
together. He drove them along the narrow road.
Then, coming to an opening in the fence, he
hurried along to the front of the procession;
then, facing about, deftly turned the whole flock
through the gate into a large field. Through this
pasture, with the skill of a military leader, he
marshaled his troop, rushing backwards and forwards,
allowing none to fall behind nor to stray
away from the proper path, finally bringing them
up in a compact body to another opening in the
opposite end of the field. On he went, driving
his small battalion along the road, then at right
angles into another road, until the whole flock
of sheep and the little black dog who commanded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page72"></a>72</span>
them disappeared for the night among the out-buildings
of a far distant farm.</p>
<p>The twilight had almost gone, and in the
growing darkness we retraced our steps to the
village, well content that, through communion
with the Spirit of Wordsworth in the presence
of that “mighty Being” who to him was the
great Teacher and Inspirer of mankind, our own
love of nature had been reawakened, and our
time well spent on this peaceful, never-to-be-forgotten
day at Windermere.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> vale of the Esk is unrivaled, even in
Scotland, for beauty and romantic interest.
From its source to where it enters the Firth of
Forth, the little river winds its way past ancient
castles with their romantic legends, famed in
poetry and song, and the picturesque homes of
barons and lairds, poets and philosophers, forming
as it goes, with rocks and cliffs, tall trees and
overhanging vines, a bewildering succession of
beautiful scenes.</p>
<p>It was <span class="correction" title="amended from to to">to</span> this charming valley that Walter
Scott came, with his young wife, in the first year
of their wedded life. A young man of imaginative
and romantic temperament, though as yet
unknown to fame, he found the place an inspiration
and delight. A pretty little cottage, with
thatched roof, and a garden commanding a beautiful
view, made the home where many happy
summers were spent. This was at Lasswade, a
village which took its striking name from the
fact—let us hope it was a fact—that here a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page76"></a>76</span>
sturdy lass was wont to wade the stream, carrying
travelers on her back,—a ferry service sufficiently
romantic to make up for its uncertainty.</p>
<p>Lockhart tells us that “it was amidst these
delicious solitudes” that Walter Scott “laid the
imperishable foundation of all his fame. It was
here that when his warm heart was beating with
young and happy love, and his whole mind and
spirit were nerved by new motives for exertion—it
was here that in the ripened glow of manhood
he seems to have first felt something of his
real strength, and poured himself out in those
splendid original ballads which were at once to
fix his name.”</p>

<p>The visitor who would see “Roslin’s rocky
glen” may take a coach in Edinburgh and soon
reach the spot after a pleasant drive over a well-kept
road. But if he would see “classic Hawthornden”
in the same day, he must go there
first. For the gate which separates the two
opens out from Hawthornden and the traveler
cannot pass in the opposite direction. We therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page77"></a>77</span>
took the train from Edinburgh, and after
half an hour alighted at a little station, from
which we walked a few hundred yards along a
quiet country road, until we reached a lodge
marking the entrance to a large estate. Entering
here, a few steps brought us to the house of
the gardener, who first conducted us to the place
that interests him the most—a large and well-kept
garden, full of fruits and vegetables, beautiful
flowers and well-trained vines. His pride
satisfied by our sincere admiration of his handiwork,
our guide was ready to reveal to us the
glory of Hawthornden, and conducted us to the
edge of a precipice known as John Knox’s Pulpit.
In front is a deep ravine of stupendous
rocks partly bare and partly covered with bushes
and pendent creepers. The tall trees on the
border, the wooded hill in the distance, and the
grand sweep of the river far below, form a
scene of majestic grandeur as nearly perfect as
one could wish. To the left, on the very edge of a
perpendicular rock, is a strong, well-built mansion,
so situated that the windows of its principal
rooms command a view of the wondrous
vale. On the other side of the house are the
ivy-covered ruins of an older castle, dating back
many centuries.</p>
<p>Since the middle of the sixteenth century,
Hawthornden has been the home of a family of
Drummonds—a famous Scottish name. William
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page78"></a>78</span>
Drummond, the most distinguished of them all,
whose name is inseparably associated with the
place, was born in 1585. His father was a gentleman-usher
at the court of King James VI, and
through his association with the Scottish royalty
had acquired the Hawthornden property. The boy
grew up amid such surroundings, was educated
at the University of Edinburgh, and traveled on
the Continent for three years before settling down
to his life-work, which he then thought would
be the practice of law. But scarcely had he returned
to Edinburgh for this purpose, when his
father died, and young Drummond, at the age
of twenty-four, found himself master of Hawthornden
with ample means at his command. All
thought of the law was abandoned forthwith.
The quiet of Hawthornden and the beauty of its
natural scenery fitted his temperament exactly.
He had already acquired a scholar’s tastes, had
read extensively, and possessed a large library in
which the Latin classics predominated, though
there were many books in Greek, Hebrew, Italian,
Spanish, French, and English. He retired to
his delightful home to live among his books, and
if he found that such surroundings became a tacit
invitation from the Muses to keep them company,
who could wonder? “Content with my
books and the use of my eyes,” he said, “I
learnt even from my boyhood to live beneath my
fortune; and, dwelling by myself as much as I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page79"></a>79</span>
can, I neither sigh for nor seek aught that is outside
me.”</p>
<p>It has been said that Drummond’s three stars
were Philosophy, Friendship, and Love. Some
three or four years after the poet began his contented
life at Hawthornden, the latter star began
to shine so brightly as to eclipse the other two.
In 1614 he met an attractive girl of seventeen or
eighteen, the daughter of Alexander Cunningham,
of Barns, a country-seat on a little stream
known as the Ore, in Fifeshire, on the opposite
side of the Firth of Forth. His poems began at
once to reveal the extent to which the loveliness
of the fair Euphame had taken possession
of him:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“Vaunt not, fair Heavens, of your two glorious lights,</p>
<p class="i05">Which, though most bright, yet see not when they shine,</p>
<p class="i05">And shining cannot show their beams divine</p>
<p class="i05">Both in one place, but part by days and nights;</p>
<p class="i05">Earth, vaunt not of those treasures ye enshrine,</p>
<p class="i05">Held only dear because hid from our sights,</p>

<p class="i05">Snow-passing ivory that the eye delights;</p>
<p class="i05">Nor, Seas, of those dear wares are in you found;</p>
<p class="i05">Vaunt not rich pearl, red coral, which do stir</p>
<p class="i05">A fond desire in fools to plunge your ground.</p>
<p class="i05">Those all more fair are to be had in her:</p>
<p class="i05">Pearl, ivory, coral, diamond, suns, gold,</p>
<p class="i05">Teeth, neck, lips, heart, eyes, hair, are to behold.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>On seeing her in a boat on the Forth he declared
her perfection:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page80"></a>80</span></p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p class="i05">Let not a wrinkle be, when you embrace</p>
<p class="i05">The boat that earth’s perfections doth contain.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The river Ore, on the banks of which he first
met his lady-love, became to Drummond the greatest
river in the world. In one sonnet he compares
the tiny stream with every famous river
from the Arno to the Nile; and finds that none
of them</p>
<p class="center ptb1 f90">“Have ever had so rare a cause of praise.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his happiness was of brief duration,
for on the very eve of the marriage, the
young lady died. Drummond’s grief was intense.
One can almost imagine him mournfully gazing
down the beautiful glen, which she might have
enjoyed with him, and exclaiming—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“Trees, happier far than I,</p>

<p class="i05">Which her sweet self contains.</p>
<p class="i05">Then make her know my endless love and pains</p>
<p class="i05">And how those tears, which from mine eyes do fall</p>
<p class="i05">Helpt you to rise so tall.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">THE SYCAMORE</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>For some years after her death, Euphame was
to Drummond what Beatrice was to Dante—the
inspirer of all that was good in him. Later in life
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page81"></a>81</span>
he married Elizabeth Logan, a lady who was
said to resemble Euphame Cunningham, and she
became the mother of his five sons and four
daughters.</p>
<p>In front of the mansion of Hawthornden is a
venerable sycamore, said to be five hundred years
old. In the month of January, 1619, according
to a favorite and oft-told story, Drummond was
sitting beneath this tree, when he saw and recognized
the huge form of Ben Jonson, as that rollicking
hero sauntered toward him along the private
road. Jonson had walked all the way from
London to see what could be seen in Scotland,
and one of the attractions had been an invitation
from Drummond, who was now beginning to be
known in England, to spend two or three weeks
at his home. As he approached, Drummond arose
and greeted him heartily, saying,—</p>
<p class="center ptb1 f90">“Welcome, welcome, royal Ben!”</p>
<p class="noind">To which Jonson quickly replied replied—</p>
<p class="center ptb1 f90">“Thankee, thankee, Hawthornden!”</p>
<p class="noind">Upon which they both laughed and felt well
acquainted at once.</p>
<p>The contrast between these two men, as they
stood under the old sycamore, must have been
strongly marked. Drummond, quiet, reserved,
and gentle in manner—Jonson, boisterous and
offensively vulgar: Drummond, well dressed and
refined in appearance—Jonson, fat, coarse,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page82"></a>82</span>
and slovenly; Drummond, a country gentleman,
accustomed to live well, but always within his
means, caring little for society, a man of correct
habits and strict piety, and later in life a loving
husband and a tender father—Jonson, the dictator
of literary London, who waved his scepter
in the “Devil Tavern” in Fleet Street, egotistical
and quarrelsome, self-assertive, a bully in disposition,
his life a perpetual round of dissipation
and debt, his means of livelihood dependent on
luck or favor, and his greatest enjoyment centering
in association with those who, like himself,
were most at home in the theaters and taverns
of the great bustling city.</p>
<p>Yet both were poets and men of genius, though
in different ways. In spite of his peculiarities,
Drummond found “rare Ben Jonson” a most
interesting companion. He kept a close record of
the conversations which passed between them,
and might well be called the father of modern
interviewing. But unlike the interviewer of to-day,
Drummond did not rush to the nearest telegraph
station to get his story “on the wire” and
“scoop” his contemporaries. There were no telegraphs
nor newspapers to call for such effort, and
Drummond had too much respect for the courtesy
due a guest to think of publishing their private
talks. But a portion of the material was published
in 1711, long after Drummond’s death,
and probably the whole of it in 1832. These
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page83"></a>83</span>
conversations with one who knew intimately most
of the literary leaders of his time have proved invaluable.
They contain Ben’s opinions of nearly
everybody—Queen Elizabeth, the Earl of Leicester,
King James, Spenser, Raleigh, Shakespeare,
Bacon, Drayton, Beaumont, Chapman,
Fletcher, and many other contemporaries. Most
of all they contain his opinion of himself and his
writings, which needless to say is quite exalted.</p>
<p>With no thought of his notes being published,
Drummond allowed himself perfect frankness in
writing about his guest. His summary of the impression
made by Ben’s visit is as follows:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>He is a great lover and praiser of himself; a contemner
and scorner of others; given rather to lose a
friend than a jest; jealous of every word and action
of those about him (especially after drink, which is
one of the elements in which he liveth); a dissembler
of ill parts which reign in him, a bragger of some good
that he wanteth; thinketh nothing well but what either
he himself or some of his friends and countrymen hath
said or done: he is passionately kind and angry; careless
either to gain or keep; vindictive, but, if he be
well answered, at himself. For any religion, as being
versed in both. Interpreted best sayings and deeds
often to the worst. Oppressed with phantasy which
hath ever mastered his reason, a general disease in
many poets.... He was in his personal character
the very reverse of Shakespeare, as surly, ill-natured,
proud and disagreeable as Shakespeare, with ten times
his merit, was gentle, good-natured, easy, and amiable.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page84"></a>84</span></p>
<p>Jonson expressed with equal frankness his opinion
of Drummond, to whom he said that he “was
too good and simple, and that oft a man’s modesty
made a fool of his wit.”</p>
<p>Drummond as a poet was classed by Robert
Southey and Thomas Campbell in the highest
rank of the British poets who appeared before
Milton. His sonnets, which are remarkable for
their exquisite delicacy and tenderness, won for
him the title of “the Scottish Petrarch.” It has
been said that they come as near to perfection as
any others of this kind of writing and that as a
sonneteer Drummond is surpassed only by Shakespeare,
Milton, and Wordsworth among the poets
who have written in English.</p>
<p>Before taking leave of the Scottish poet and
his picturesque home, we paused for a few minutes
to visit the wondrous caverns, cut out of the
solid rock upon which the house is built. Antiquarians
have insisted that these caves date back
to the time of the Picts, at least as far as the
ninth or tenth century.</p>
<p>This, too, was the popular understanding before
the scientists offered their opinion. In a
curious old volume, published in 1753,<a href="#ft2" id="fa2" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">2</span></a> we are
told:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>Underneath [the house of Drummond] are the noted
Caverns of <i>Hawthorn-Den</i>, by Dr. <i>Stuckely</i> in his
<i>Itinerarium-Curiosa</i>, said to have been the King of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page85"></a>85</span>
<i>Pictlands</i> Castle or Palace; which nothing can shew
the Doctor’s Credulity more than by suffering himself
to be imposed upon by the Tattle of the Vulgar, who
in all things they cannot account for, are ascribed to
the <i>Picts</i>, without the least Foundation. For those
caves, instead of having been a Castle or Palace, I
take them either to have been a Receptacle for Robbers,
or Places to secure the People and their Effects
in, during the destructive Wars between the <i>Picts</i> and
<i>English</i>, and <i>Scots</i> and <i>English</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>During the contests between Bruce and Baliol
for the Scottish crown, these caves became a place
of refuge for Bruce and his friends, and one
of the rooms is still pointed out as Bruce’s bedchamber.</p>

<p>In the walls are many square holes, from twelve
to eighteen inches deep, supposed to have been
used as cupboards. On a rough table near one
of the openings is a rude and very much damaged
desk, said to have been the property of
John Knox.</p>
<p>Leaving these gloomy resorts of ancient heroes—perhaps
of ancient robbers—we sought a
brighter and more cheerful scene. Descending
the path we reached a bridge over the Esk on
which is a gate that permitted us to leave Hawthornden,
although it does not allow wanderers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page86"></a>86</span>
on the other side to enter. The bridge gave a
fine opportunity for a farewell view of the grand
old mansion, high in the air at the top of the
cliff, which we were now viewing from below.</p>
<p>A delightful stroll along the left bank of the
stream for about two miles brought us to Roslin
Castle, situated on a rocky promontory high above
the river. At the point of the peninsula the river
is narrowed by a large mass of reddish sandstone
over which it falls. When flooded this becomes a
beautiful cascade,—whence the name, “Ross,”
a Gaelic word meaning promontory or jutting
rock, and “Lyn,” a waterfall,—the “Rock of
the Waterfall.” The Esk, where it forms the cascade,
is still called “the Lynn.” The view from
the promontory is one of the most delightful to
be imagined. The banks are precipitous and covered
with a luxurious growth of natural wood.
The vale seems to be crowded with every possible
combination of trees and cliffs, foliage and sparkling
stream, that nature can put together to form
a region of romantic suggestion.</p>

as the entire kitchen of one of our modern houses,
suggests the lavish scale upon which the establishment
was once conducted.</p>
<p>The castle was built by a family of St. Clairs,
whose ancestor, Waldernus de St. Clair, came over
with the Conqueror. William St. Clair, Baron of
Roslin, Earl of Caithness and Prince of the Orkneys,
who flourished in the middle of the fifteenth
century, was one of the most famous of these
barons. He lived in the magnificence of royal
state.</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>He kept a great court and was royally served at his
own table in vessels of gold and silver.... He had
his halls and other apartments richly adorned with
embroidered hangings. His princess, Elizabeth Douglas,
was served by seventy-five gentlewomen, whereof
fifty-three were daughters of noblemen, all clothed in
velvet and silks, with their chains of gold, and other
ornaments; and was attended by two hundred riding
gentlemen in all her journeys; and if it happened to
be dark when she went to Edinburgh, where her lodgings
were at the foot of the Black Friar’s Wynd, eighty
lighted torches were carried before her.<a href="#ft3" id="fa3" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>The castle was accidentally set on fire in 1447
and badly damaged, and was leveled to the ground
by English forces under the Earl of Hertford, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page88"></a>88</span>
1544, who was sent to Scotland by Henry VIII
to seek to enforce the marriage of his son Edward
to the infant Mary of Scotland, the daughter of
James V. In 1650 it was again destroyed, during
Cromwell’s campaign in Scotland, by General
Monk, and rising again, suffered severely at the
hands of a mob from Edinburgh in 1688.</p>
<p>It was William St. Clair, the feudal baron above
referred to, who built the exquisitely beautiful
chapel which stands not far from the castle. The
same ancient manuscript, previously quoted, informs
us that</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>His age creeping on him made him consider how he
had spent his time past, and how to spend that which
was to come. Therefore to the end he might not seem
altogether unthankfull to God for the benefices receaved
from Him, it came in his minde to build a house
for God’s service of most curious work, the which,
that it might be done with greater glory and splendour
he caused artificers to be brought from other regions
and forraigne kingdoms and caused dayly to be
abundance of all kinde of workemen present, etc., etc.</p>
</div>
<p>The foundation of Roslin Chapel was laid in
1446. It was originally intended to be a cruciform
structure with a high central tower. The
existing chapel is, therefore, really only a small
part of what the church was meant to be. Its
style is called “florid Gothic,” but this is probably
for want of a better name. There is no other
piece of architecture like it in the world. It is a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page89"></a>89</span>
medley of all architectures, the Egyptian, Grecian,
Roman, and Saracenic being intermingled with
all kinds of decorations and designs, some exquisitely
beautiful and others quaint and even grotesque.
There are thirteen different varieties of
the arch. The owner, who possessed great wealth,
desired novelty. He secured it by engaging architects
and builders from all parts of Europe. The
most beautiful feature of the interior is known as
the “’Prentice’s Pillar.” It is a column with
richly carved spiral wreaths of beautiful foliage
twined about from floor to ceiling. It is said that
the master-builder, when he came to erect this
column, found himself unable to carry out the
design, and traveled to Rome to see a column of
similar description there. When he returned he
found that his apprentice had studied the plans
in his absence and with greater genius than his
own, had overcome the difficulties and fashioned
a pillar more beautiful than any ever before
dreamed of. The master, stung with jealous rage,
struck the apprentice with his mallet, killing him
instantly. This, at least, is the accepted legend.</p>
<p>The barons of Roslin were buried beneath the
chapel side by side, encased in their full suits of
armor. There was a curious superstition that when
one of the family died, the chapel was enveloped
in flames, but not consumed. This and the “uncoffined
chiefs” are referred to by Scott in “The
Lay of the Last Minstrel.” The lady is lost in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page90"></a>90</span>
the storm while crossing the Firth on her way to
Roslin:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“O’er Roslin all that dreary night</p>
<p class="i2">A wondrous blaze was seen to gleam;</p>

<p class="i2">And redder than the bright moonbeam.</p>
<p class="s">“It glared on Roslin’s castled rock,</p>

</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Commemorated by a tablet in the chapel is
another interesting legend. Robert Bruce, King
of Scotland, in following the chase on Pentland
Hills near Roslin, had often started “a white
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page91"></a>91</span>
faunch deer” which invariably escaped from his
hounds. In his vexation he asked his nobles
whether any of them had hounds which would
likely be more successful. All hesitated for fear
that the mere suggestion of possessing dogs superior
to those of the king might be an offense.
But Sir William St. Clair (one of the predecessors
of the builder of the chapel) boldly and unceremoniously
came forward and said he would
wager his head that his two favorite dogs Hold
and Help would kill the deer before it could
cross the March burn. The king promptly accepted
the rash wager, and betted the forest of
Pentland Moor.</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>The hunters reach the heathern steeps and Sir William,
posting himself in the best situation for slipping
his dogs, prayed devoutly to Christ, the Virgin Mary,
and St. Katherine. The deer is started, the hounds
are slipped; when Sir William spurs his gallant steed
and cheers the dogs. The deer reaches the middle of
the March-burn brook, the hounds are still in the
rear, and our hero’s life is at its crisis. An awful moment;
the hunter threw himself from his horse in despair
and Fate seemed to sport with his feelings. At
the critical moment Hold fastened on the game, and
Help coming up, turned the deer back and killed it
close by Sir William’s side. The generous monarch
embraced the knight and bestowed on him the lands
of Kirktown, Logan House, Earnsham, etc., in free
forestrie.<a href="#ft4" id="fa4" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page92"></a>92</span></p>
<p>The grateful Sir William erected a chapel to
St. Katherine, at the spot, to commemorate the
saint’s intervention.</p>
<p>One more tale of Roslin remains to be told.
Not far away, on Roslin Moor, occurred one of
the famous battles of Scottish history. There
were really three battles, all fought in one day,
the 24th of February, 1303. Three divisions of
the English army, consisting of thirty thousand
men, were successively attacked by the valiant
Scots with only ten thousand men, who, after
overpowering the first division, attacked the second,
and then the third, defeating all three in
the same day.</p>
<p>And so, with history and legend, poetry and
romance, real life and fiction, the glory of nature’s
art and the achievements of human handicraft
all happily intermingled in our thought
and blended into one pleasant memory, we brought
to its close our walk through the valley of the
Esk, from Hawthornden to Roslin Glen.</p>

<span class="f90">MRS. WARD AND HER WORK</span></p>
<p class="noind"><span class="chap1 sc">“‘Why</span> does any one stay in England who
<i>can</i> make the trip to Paradise?’ said the
duchess, as she leaned lazily back in the corner
of the boat and trailed her fingers in the waters
of Como.”</p>
<p>These words from “Lady Rose’s Daughter”
came to mind as we glided swiftly in a little
motor-boat, late in the afternoon of a perfect
April day, over the smooth waters of Como and
into the arm of the lake known as Lecco, where
we were to enjoy our cup of tea in a little <i>latteria</i>
high up on a rocky crag. In the stern sat Mrs.
Ward, looking the picture of contentment, a light
summer hat with simple trimmings giving an almost
girlish aspect to a face in which strong
intellectuality and depth of moral purpose were
clearly the predominating features. A day’s work
done,—for Mrs. Ward goes to Como for work, not
play,—this little trip across the lake was one of
her favorite recreations, in which, for the time,
we were hospitably permitted to share. About
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page96"></a>96</span>
us were the scenes “enchanted, incomparable,”
which are best described in the words of Mrs.
Ward herself:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>When Spring descends upon the shores of the Lago
di Como, she brings with her all the graces, all the
beauties, all the fine, delicate, and temperate delights
of which earth and sky are capable, and she pours
them forth upon a land of perfect loveliness. Around
the shores of other lakes—Maggiore, Lugano, Garda—blue
mountains rise and the vineyards spread their
green and dazzling terraces to the sun. Only Como
can show in unmatched union a main composition, incomparably
grand and harmonious, combined with
every jeweled or glowing or exquisite detail. Nowhere
do the mountains lean towards each other in such an
ordered splendor as that which bends around the
northern shores of Como. Nowhere do buttressed
masses rise behind each other, to right and left of a
blue waterway, in lines statelier or more noble than
those kept by the mountains of Lecco Lake as they
marshal themselves on either hand, along the approaches
to Lombardy and Venetia.</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">MRS. HUMPHRY WARD AND MISS DOROTHY WARD</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>... And within this divine framework, between
the glistening snows which still, in April, crown and
glorify the heights, and those reflections of them
which lie encalmed in the deep bosom of the lake,
there’s not a foot of pasture, not a shelf of vineyard,
not a slope of forest, where the spring is not at work,
dyeing the turf with gentians, starring it with narcissuses,
or drawing across it the first golden network of
the chestnut leaves; where the mere emerald of the
grass is not in itself a thing to refresh the very
springs of being; where the peach-blossom and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page97"></a>97</span>
wild cherry and the olive are not perpetually weaving
patterns on the blue which ravish the very heart out
of your breast. And already the roses are beginning
to pour over the wall; the wistaria is climbing up the
cypresses; a pomp of camellias and azaleas is in all
the gardens; while in the glassy bays that run up into
the hills the primrose banks still keep their sweet
austerity, and the triumph of spring over the just
banished winter is still sharp and new.</p>
</div>
<p>It was in a garden such as this, with a wild
cherry tree and olives “perpetually weaving patterns”
against the blue sky, that we first met
Mrs. Ward. It was a balmy April morning. The
scent of spring was in the air, and the birds were
adding their melody to the beauty of the landscape.
The villa stands well up the slope of a high
hill and is reached by a winding path through
fragrant trees. A little below the level of the
house is a shady nook, well sheltered from the
sun, from which the high mountains of the north
and the blue glimmer of the lake beneath can be
plainly seen. Here we were greeted by the novelist
in terms of cordiality that instantly made us “feel
at home.” There was no posing, none of that
condescension which some writers had led us to
expect. We were simply welcomed as friends,
with a perfect hospitality that seemed to be born
of the tranquil beauty all about us.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ward is a woman of rather more than
medium height and of erect and graceful carriage.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page98"></a>98</span>
Her manner is dignified, but it is the dignity
of one properly conscious of her own strength
and is never repellent. One cannot help feeling
that he is in the presence of a distinguished person—one
who has justly earned a world-wide
fame—and yet one in whom the attributes of
true womanliness reign supreme. You are proud
of the honor of her friendship, and yet you cannot
help thinking what an excellent neighbor she
would be.</p>
<p>The instinct which impels Mrs. Ward to seek
such scenes of beauty as Lake Como in which to
do her writing came to her naturally, for her
childhood was spent in one of the most beautiful
parts of all England, Westmoreland, the home of
Wordsworth and of Ruskin. Here “Arnold of
Rugby” made his home in a charmingly situated
cottage known as Fox How. “Fox,” in the language
of Westmoreland, means “fairy,” and
“how” is “hill.” A “fairy hill” indeed it must
have seemed to Dr. Arnold’s little granddaughter
Mary, when as a child of five she was brought
there by her father from far-away Tasmania,
where she was born. The English Lakes are
famous for their beauty, but there is no more
delightful spot in all the region than the valley
“under Loughrigg,” and no lovelier river than the
Rothay, rippling over the smooth pebbles from
Wordsworth’s beloved Rydal Water down to the
more pretentious grandeur of Lake Windermere.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page99"></a>99</span>
The impressions of her childhood created in the
future novelist an intense love of these streams
and mountains, which only increased with her
absence and the enlargement of her field of
vision. When she was the mother of a little girl
of seven and a boy of four, she determined to
give to them the same impressions which had delighted
her own childhood, and the family made
an ever-memorable visit from Oxford, where they
were then living, to the vicinity of Fox How—a
visit which all children may enjoy who will read
the pretty little story of “Milly and Olly.”</p>
<p>Mary Augusta Arnold was born in Tasmania
on the 11th of June, 1851. Her father, Thomas
Arnold, second son of Dr. Arnold of Rugby and
brother of Matthew Arnold, was at that time Inspector
of Schools in the far-away island. He had
married the granddaughter of Colonel Sorell, a
former Governor of Tasmania, and no doubt intended
to remain there permanently. But, becoming
interested, even at that distance, in the
so-called “Oxford Movement” of the middle of
the last century, he determined to return to England,
where he followed Newman and others into
the Roman Catholic Church, accepting a professorship
of English Literature in the Catholic
University of Dublin. His daughter Mary, the
eldest of six, was sent to Ambleside to be educated.
In 1865, having renounced the Catholic
faith, Mr. Arnold took up his residence at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100"></a>100</span>
Oxford. Here his eldest daughter, at the age of
fourteen, came under the influence of the friendships
and associations which were to have so potent
an influence upon her future career. The
most important of these were Professor Mark
Pattison and the Bodleian Library. Professor
Pattison strongly urged her to specialize her
studies, and acting upon his suggestion, she
learned the Spanish language and began a course
of study in Spanish literature and history, in
which she found the facilities of the Bodleian
Library invaluable. In 1872 she became the wife
of Mr. Thomas Humphry Ward, then a fellow
and tutor in Brasenose College. During the ensuing
ten or eleven years Mrs. Ward assisted her
husband in his literary work and contributed
largely to the “Pall Mall Gazette,” the “Saturday
Review,” the “Academy,” and other magazines,
besides publishing the little book for children
already referred to, “Milly and Olly.”</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">
<tbody><tr><td class="figcenter"><img alt="" src="images/img151.jpg" style="width:750px; height:512px" id="id-7952037029894477068"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">“UNDER LOUGHRIGG”</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>In 1881 Mr. Ward accepted a position on the
staff of the “Times,” and the family removed to
London. For several years they occupied a house
in Russell Square, which Mrs. Ward still regards
with fond memories, later removing to their present
town house, No. 25 Grosvenor Place. But
Mrs. Ward’s love of nature is too intense for an
uninterrupted residence in London, and she possesses
an ideal country home some thirty miles
away, near the little village of Aldbury, known
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101"></a>101</span>
as “Stocks.” This large and beautiful estate is
ancient enough to be mentioned in “Domesday
Book.” Its name does not come from the old
“stocks” used as an instrument of punishment,
which may still be seen in the village, although
this is a common supposition. “Stocks” is derived
from the German “stock,” meaning stick
or tree, and refers to the magnificent grove by
which the house is surrounded.</p>
<p>Before Stocks became a possibility, Mrs. Ward
usually managed to choose a summer home in the
country, and these choices are most interestingly
reflected in her novels. During the Oxford residence
Surrey was a favorite resort for seven years,
its atmosphere entering largely into the composition
of “Miss Bretherton” and “Robert
Elsmere.” Two nights spent at a farm on the
Kinderscout gave ample material for the opening
chapter of the “History of David Grieve.”
The lease for a season of Hampden House, in
Buckinghamshire, gave the original for Mellor
Park in “Marcella,” and a visit near Crewe fixed
the scenes of “Sir George Tressady.” “Helbeck
of Bannisdale” was the result of a summer spent
in the delightful home of Captain Bagot, of Levens
Hall, near Kendal. Summers in Italy and
Switzerland gave most charming scenery for
“Lady Rose’s Daughter” and “Eleanor,” and,
to a less degree, “The Marriage of William
Ashe.” The cottage of her youngest daughter,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page102"></a>102</span>
Dorothy, near the Langdale Pikes, suggested the
home of Fenwick, while Diana Mallory found
her home in Stocks itself. Thus the creatures of
Mrs. Ward’s fancy have simply lived in the places
which she knew the best. They are all scenes of
beauty, for Mrs. Ward loves the beautiful in
nature, and has spent her life where this yearning
could be most fully gratified.</p>
<p>But if Mrs. Ward seeks the country as the
best place for literary work, she is not idle when
in the city. If any one imagines her to be merely
a society woman with a genius for literature, he
is making a serious mistake. Outside of society
and literature she is a busy woman, bent on the
accomplishment of a task which few would have
the courage to assume. Her ideal is best expressed
in the closing words of “Robert Elsmere”:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>The New Brotherhood still exists, and grows. There
are many who imagined that, as it had been raised
out of the earth by Elsmere’s genius, so it would sink
with him. Not so! He would have fought the struggle
to victory with surpassing force, with a brilliancy and
rapidity none after him could rival. But the struggle
was not his. His effort was but a fraction of the effort
of the race. In that effort, and in the Divine force
behind it, is our trust, as was his.</p>
</div>
<p>These words, written nearly a quarter of a
century ago, were truly prophetic. For Mrs.
Ward not only possesses the kind of genius from
which an Elsmere could be created, but is gifted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103"></a>103</span>
with a rare capacity for business, which has enabled
her to crystallize the ideals of her work of
fiction into a substantial and permanent institution
for practical benevolence. She was already
interested in “settlement” work among the poor
of London during the writing of the novel. But
in 1891, after the storm of criticism which the
book aroused had subsided, its suggestions began
to take definite shape in the organization
of the Passmore Edwards Settlement, in University
Hall, in Gordon Square. In 1898 the
work was moved to its present quarters in Tavistock
Place, where, under the leadership of Mrs.
Ward and through the generosity of herself and
the friends whom she had been able to influence,
a large and substantial building was erected.
Directly in the rear of the building is a large
garden owned by the Duke of Bedford, who
recently placed it at the disposal of the Settlement,
keeping it in order at his own expense, resowing
the grass every year to keep it fresh and
thick. Here in the vacation season one thousand
children daily enjoy the luxury of sitting and
walking on the grass, and that in the heart of
central London. The garden occupies the site
of Dickens’s Tavistock House. One cannot help
imagining the author of Little Nell sitting there
in spirit while troops of happy London children
pass in review. The land here placed entirely
at the disposal of Mrs. Ward and the warden
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104"></a>104</span>
of the Settlement is worth not less than half a
million dollars. Twenty-seven teachers, under
the direction of a competent supervisor, give instruction
in organized out-of-door exercises.</p>
<p>This was the first of the recreation schools or
play centers. Handwork occupations, such as
cooking—both for girls and boys—sewing, knitting,
basket-work, carpentering, cobbling, clay
modeling, painting and drawing; dancing combined
with old English songs and nursery rhymes;
musical drill and gymnastics; quiet games and
singing games; acting; and a children’s library
of story-books and picture-books—these are the
provisions which have been made for the fortunate
children of that locality.</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">
<tbody><tr><td class="figcenter"><img alt="" src="images/img157.jpg" style="width:700px; height:481px" id="id-4496600248488981921"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">THE PASSMORE EDWARDS SETTLEMENT HOUSE</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The entire purpose of such play centers is to
rescue the children of the poor from the demoralization
that results from being turned out to
play after school hours in the streets and alleyways,
where they are subjected to every kind of
vile association and influence. The effects already
noted by those in charge of the centers are improvement
in manners, in thoughtfulness for the
little ones, and in unselfishness; increase in regard
for truth and honesty; the development of
the instinct in all children to “make something”;
the teaching that it is more enjoyable to play together
in harmony than when obedience to a
leader is refused. The success of this first experiment
was so marked that gradually other centers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105"></a>105</span>
were started in different parts of London. Liberal
sums of money were placed in the hands of Mrs.
Ward, who enlisted the support of the County
Council to the extent of securing facilities in the
public school buildings. The work has so far progressed
that the total attendance last year<a href="#ft5" id="fa5" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">5</span></a> reached
an aggregate of six hundred thousand. It is difficult
to estimate from these figures how many
children were affected, but, taking—at a guess—fifty
times as the average attendance of each,
this would mean that the lives of at least twelve
thousand poor children were directly lifted up
by this practical charity, and that as many more
hard-working and anxious parents were indirectly
benefited.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Ward will not be satisfied until the
entire school population of London has been
made to feel the influence of these play centers.
Private beneficence, as she has plainly pointed
out, can never solve the problem. “Private
effort,” said she in a well-known letter to the
London “Times,” “cannot deal with seven hundred
and fifty thousand children, or even with
three hundred thousand. If there is a serious
and urgent need, if both the physique and the
morale of our town children are largely at stake,
and if private persons can only touch a fraction
of the problem, what remains but to appeal to the
public conscience?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page106"></a>106</span></p>
<p>This is Mrs. Ward’s way of “doing things.”
She does not appeal to public authority to accomplish
an ideal without first finding a way and
proving that it can be done. But, having clearly
demonstrated her proposition at private expense,
she does not rest content with the results so obtained,
but pushes steadily forward toward the
larger ideal, which can be realized only through
public support.</p>
<p>But the recreation school is only a part of the
work of the Passmore Edwards Settlement. During
the daytime many of the rooms are used by
the “Cripple Schools.” Children who are suffering
from spinal diseases, heart trouble, and deformities
of various kinds which prevent attendance
at the regular schools are daily brought to
the Settlement in ambulances. Here the little
ones do all kinds of kindergarten work, while
the older ones are instructed in drawing, sewing,
bent-iron work, and other suitable tasks. As an
outgrowth of this school twenty-three cripple
schools are now in operation in London.</p>
<p>But it is in the evening that the Passmore
Edwards Settlement is seen to best advantage.
There is a large library containing some three
thousand volumes, which are kept in active use.
On Monday nights two tables in this room are
the centers of busy groups. These represent the
“coal club,” a businesslike charity of a very
practical kind. The club buys a large quantity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page107"></a>107</span>
of coal in the summer-time, when it can be obtained
cheapest. As a large consumer, it usually
gets every possible concession. The members of
this club can buy the coal in small quantities as
wanted, or as they are able to pay for it, at any
time during the year, at the summer price of one
shilling one and a half pence per hundred weight
(twenty-seven cents). If bought during the winter
in the ordinary way, they would have to pay
perhaps five or six pence more—a very substantial
saving. Thrift is encouraged by allowing
members to deposit small sums in the summer to
apply against their winter purchases. Last year the
club transacted a business equal to about $4300.</p>
<p>“The Poor Man’s Lawyer” is another practical
part of the work. Once each week free legal
advice is given to all who ask it, and considerable
money has been saved to people who, from ignorance
and poverty, might have been imposed
upon. The “Men’s Club,” the “Boys’ Club,” the
“Factory Girls’ Club,” and the “Women’s Club”
are all actively engaged in performing the usual
functions of such organizations. There is a gymnasium
where boys and girls, men and women, all
have their regular turns of systematic instruction.</p>
<p>An orchestra of a dozen pieces and a choral
society of forty members, together with a dramatic
society, give opportunity for many to take
part in numerous concerts and entertainments. A
large hall is the scene nearly every night of some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page108"></a>108</span>
kind of social amusement. The room is decorated
with many pictures, all reproductions of the best
works of art, while around the walls are placed
busts in marble of Emerson, James Martineau,
Dickens, Matthew Arnold, Benjamin Jowett, and
Sir William Herschel—the gift of Mr. Passmore
Edwards. There is a large stage for dramatic performances,
drills, etc., with a piano and a good
organ. There are tables where the members may
play cards, smoke, or have light refreshments.
On Sunday nights there are concerts or lectures.
The whole atmosphere of the place is attractive
to the men and women who frequent it. There is
no obtrusive piety, no patronizing air, nothing to
offend the pride of the poor man who values his
self-esteem, yet all the influences of the place are
elevating.</p>
<p>The whole spirit of the Settlement is expressed
in these words, displayed in a framed notice at
the entrance to the social hall:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>We believe that many changes in the conditions of
life and labour are <span class="correction" title="amended from neeeded">needed</span>, and are coming to pass;
but we believe also that men, without any change except
in themselves and in their feelings towards one
another, might make this world a better and a happier
place.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the same sympathies but different
experiences of life, we meet to exchange ideas and to
discuss social questions, in the hope that, as we learn
to know one another better, a feeling of fellowship
may arise among us.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page109"></a>109</span></p>
<p>To these ends we have a Library, Clubs, Lectures,
Classes, Entertainments, etc., and we endeavour to
make the Settlement a centre where we may unite our
several resources in a social and intellectual home.</p>
</div>
<p>In all this work Mrs. Humphry Ward is the
inspiration, and a moving, active spirit. Her name
stands next to that of the wealthy Duke of Bedford
as the most liberal contributor. She is the
Honorable Secretary of the Council, a member
of the Finance Committee, president of the
Women’s Club, etc. But these are only her
official positions. Her directing hand is manifest
in every branch of the work, and, from the warden
down to the humblest member of the Girls’
Club, her name is accorded a respect amounting
almost to reverence.</p>
<p>But, as with the play centers, Mrs. Ward is
not content with the work of this one institution,
splendid as it is. To her it is only the means of
ascertaining the way. She feels that she is dealing
with a great problem, and her method is to
ascertain, first of all, the best solution, and then
to use her large influence to induce others to
take up the work. Thus the “New Brotherhood”
of Robert Elsmere has not only continued to exist
for a quarter of a century, but has in it the
elements of growth which will make it a vital
power in human society long after the real
Robert Elsmere, in the person of Mrs. Ward, has
ceased to be the directing force.</p>

<p class="center pt2">II<br>
<span class="f90">THE REAL ROBERT ELSMERE</span></p>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> seeking to point out the real persons and
places of Mrs. Ward’s novels, it is only fair to
the author to begin with her own statement as
to the story-teller’s method of procedure:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>An idea, a situation, is suggested to him by real life,
he takes traits and peculiarities from this or that person
whom he has known or seen, but that is all. When
he comes to write ... the mere necessities of an imaginative
effort oblige him to cut himself adrift from
reality. His characters become to him the creatures of
a dream, as vivid often as his waking life, but still a
dream. And the only portraits he is drawing are portraits
of phantoms, of which the germs were present
in reality, but to which he himself has given voice,
garb, and action.</p>
</div>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">THE LIME WALK</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>It is my purpose to point out some of these
“germs of reality” in Mrs. Ward’s work, relying
for the essential facts, at least, upon information
given me personally by the novelist herself.
For Mrs. Ward does not hesitate to admit
that certain characters were drawn from real life;
but she insists upon a proper understanding of
the exact sense in which this is true. Because
“Miss Bretherton” was suggested by the career
of Mary Anderson it does not follow that all that
is said of the former is true of the latter. There
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page111"></a>111</span>
is a vast difference between a “suggestion” and
a “portrait.” The thoughts and feelings or the
personal characteristics of a certain individual
may suggest a character who in his physical
aspects, his environment, and the events of his
career may be conceived as an individual totally
different. Mrs. Ward’s novels contain no portraits
and no history. But they abound in characters
suggested by people whom she has known,
in incidents and reminiscences of real life, and
in vivid word-pictures of scenes which she has
learned to love or of places with which she is
personally familiar.</p>
<p>A study of the scenery of these novels properly
begins in the County of Surrey. About four
miles southwest of Godalming is Borough Farm,
an old-fashioned brick house, which we reached
by a drive over country that seemed in places
almost like a desert—so wild and forsaken that
one could scarcely believe it to be within a few
miles of some of the busiest suburbs of London.
But it has a splendid beauty of its own. The
thick gorse with its golden blossoms everywhere
waves a welcome. There are now and then great
oaks to greet you, and graceful patches of white
birch. And everywhere is a delightfully exhilarating
sense of freedom and fresh air such as only
this kind of open country can suggest. Here
Mrs. Ward lived for seven summers, finding in
the country round about some of the most interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page112"></a>112</span>
of the scenes of her first novel, “Miss
Bretherton,” and of “Robert Elsmere.”</p>
<p>“Miss Bretherton” was published in 1884.
Mary Anderson was at that time the reigning
success on the London stage, while Sarah Bernhardt,
in Paris, was startling the world with an
art of a totally different character. The beauty
of the young American actress was the one subject
of conversation. Was it her beauty that attracted
the crowds to the theater, and that alone?
Was she totally lacking in that consummate art
which the great Frenchwoman admittedly possessed?
These questions suggested to Mrs. Ward
the theme of her first attempt at fiction. The
beautiful Miss Bretherton is taken in hand by a
party of friends representing the highest types
of culture. In their effort to give her mind and
body much-needed rest from the exactions of
London society she is carried away on two notable
excursions. The first is to Surrey, the real
scene of this outing being a place near Borough
Farm called “Forked Pond,” well known to Mrs.
Ward and her family while residents at the farm.
The other is to Oxford, where, after admiring the
colleges, which brought many happy recollections
to the gentlemen of the party, Miss Bretherton
is taken to Nuneham Park, a beautiful place
on the river where a small rustic bridge enhances
the romantic character of the surroundings. This,
of course, was familiar ground to the author, who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page113"></a>113</span>
spent sixteen happy years in that vicinity as a
resident of Oxford. Through the kindness of
these friends, and particularly by the influence of
Kendal, who becomes her lover, Miss Bretherton
is made to take a new view of her art, and is transformed
into an actress of real dramatic power.</p>
<p>Although a charming story, “Miss Bretherton”
did not prove successful and had little part
in making the reputation of the novelist, who is
likely to be known as “the author of ‘Robert
Elsmere,’” so long as her fame shall endure.
For this great book created a sensation throughout
the English-speaking world when it appeared,
and aroused controversies which did not subside
for many years.</p>
<p>The scenery of “Robert Elsmere” combines
the Westmoreland which Mrs. Ward learned to
love in her childhood with the Oxford of her
girlhood and early married life, and the Surrey
where so many pleasant summers were spent.
Not wishing, for fear of recognition, to describe
the country near Ambleside, with which she was
most familiar, Mrs. Ward placed the scenes of
the opening chapters in the neighboring valley
of Long Sleddale, giving it the name of Long
Whindale. Whinborough is the city of Kendal,
and the village of Shanmoor is Kentmere. Burwood
Farm, where the Leyburns lived, is a house
far up the valley, which still “peeps through the
trees” at the passer-by just as it did in the days
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page114"></a>114</span>
when Robert Elsmere first met the saintly Catherine
there. A few hundred yards down the
stream is a little stone church across the road
from a small stone schoolhouse, and next to the
school a gray stone vicarage, standing high above
the little river, all three bearing the date 1863.
At sight of this group of <span class="correction" title="amended from buidings">buildings</span> one almost
expects to catch a glimpse of the well-meaning
but not over-wise Mrs. Thornburgh, sitting in
the shade of the vicarage, awaiting the coming
of old John Backhouse, the carrier, with the
anxiously expected consignment of “airy and
appetizing trifles” from the confectioner’s.</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">
<tbody><tr><td class="figcenter"><img alt="" src="images/img171.jpg" style="width:700px; height:480px" id="id-3174228021968551535"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">COTTAGE OF “MARY BACKHOUSE”</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>At the extreme end of the valley the road abruptly
comes to an end. A stone bridge leads off
to the left to a group of three small farms. In
front no sign of human habitation meets the eye.
The hills seem to come together, forming a kind
of bowl, and there is no sound to break the stillness
save the ripple of the river. It was to this
lonely spot that Catherine was in the habit of
walking, quite alone, to visit the dying Mary
Backhouse. The house of John and Jim Backhouse
where Mary died may still be seen. It is
the oldest of the three farms above mentioned.
A very small cottage, it is wedged between a
stable on one side and a sort of barn or storehouse
on the other, so that from the road before
crossing the bridge it seems to be quite pretentious.
The house dates back to 1670.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115"></a>115</span>
Mary Backhouse never existed except in imagination,
but Mrs. Ward, upon seeing the photograph
of the house, exclaimed with much
satisfaction, “Yes, that is the very house where
Mary Backhouse died.” So real to her are the
events described in her novels that Mrs. Ward
frequently refers to the scenes in this way. Behind
the house is a very steep hill, covered with
trees and rough stones. It was over this hill
that Robert and Catherine walked on the night
of Mary Backhouse’s death. Readers of “Robert
Elsmere” will remember that poor Mary was the
victim of a strange hallucination. On the night
of Midsummer Day, one year before, she had
seen the ghost or “bogle” of “Bleacliff Tarn.”
To see the ghost was terror enough, but to be
spoken to by it was the sign of death within a
year. And Mary had both seen and been spoken
to by the ghost. Her mind, so far as she had one,
for she was really half-insane, was concentrated
on the one horrible thought—that on Midsummer
Night she must die. The night had
at last arrived, and Catherine, true to her charitable
impulses, was there to comfort the dying
girl.</p>
<p>The weather was growing darker and stormier;
the wind shook the house in gusts, and the farther
shoulder of High Fell was almost hidden by
the trailing rain-clouds. But Catherine feared
nothing when a human soul was in need, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page116"></a>116</span>
hoping to pacify the poor woman, volunteered
to go out to the top of the Fell and over the
very track of the ghost at the precise hour when
she was supposed to walk, to prove that there
was nothing near “but the dear old hills and the
power of God.” As she opened the door of the
kitchen, Catherine was surprised to find Robert
Elsmere there, and together they set out, over the
rough, stony path, facing the wind and rain as
they climbed the distant fell-side. There Robert
pleaded his love against Catherine’s stern sense
of duty, and won.</p>
<p>When Robert and Catherine were married,
they went to live at the Rectory of Murewell, in
Surrey. This old house is at Peper Harow, three
miles west of Godalming and a mile or so from
Borough Farm. It was leased for one summer
by Mrs. Ward. A plain, square house of stone,
much discolored by the weather, it could hardly
be called attractive in itself. But stepping back
to the road, with its picturesque stone wall surmounted
by foliage, and viewing the house as
it appears from there, flanked on the left by a
fine spreading elm and on the right by a tall,
pointed fir and a cluster of oaks, with a little
flower garden under the windows and the gracefully
curving walk leading past the door in a
semicircle stretching from gate to gate, the ugly
house is transformed into a home of beauty,
where Robert and Catherine, one can well imagine,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117"></a>117</span>
might have been quite happy and contented
with their surroundings.</p>
<p>In the rear of the house is the garden, famous
for its phloxes, the scene of many walks
and family confidences. At the farther end is
the gate where Langham poured out the story
of his life in passionate speech, impelled by the
equally passionate sympathy of Rose, only to
recall himself a moment later, “the critic in
him making the most bitter, remorseless mock of
all these heroics and despairs the other self had
been indulging in.”</p>
<p>Only a short walk from the Rectory is the little
church of Peper Harow, the scene of Robert’s
early clerical labors, and further on is the large
and beautiful Peper Harow Park, the present
home of Lord Middleton. This attractive park
is the original of Squire Wendover’s, but the
house itself is not described. The fine library
owned by the Squire, which so delighted Robert
Elsmere with its many rare books, was in reality
the famous Bodleian Library of Oxford, with
which the author became familiar very early in
life.</p>
<p>Three characters from real life, each a man of
marked individuality, stand out prominently in
the pages of “Robert Elsmere.” These are Professor
Mark Pattison, whose strong personality
and scholarly attainments suggested Squire Wendover;
Professor Thomas H. Green, the original of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page118"></a>118</span>
Mr. Grey; and the melancholy Swiss philosopher,
poet, and dreamer Amiel, who was the prototype
of Langham.</p>
<p>The theme of the novel is the development
of Robert Elsmere’s character and the gradual
change of his religious views, brought about
through many a bitter struggle. In this the principal
influence was that of Roger Wendover, a
typical English squire of large possessions, but,
in addition, a scholar of the first rank, the possessor
of a large library filled with rare and important
volumes of history, philosophy, science,
and religion, with the contents of which he was
thoroughly familiar, and an author of two great
books, one of which had stirred up a tremendous
excitement in the circles of English religious
thought.</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>The Pentateuch, the Prophets, the Gospels, St.
Paul, Tradition, the Fathers, Protestantism and Justification
by Faith, the Eighteenth Century, the Broad
Church Movement, Anglican Theology—the Squire
had his say about them all. And while the coolness
and frankness of the method sent a shock of indignation
and horror through the religious public, the subtle
and caustic style, and the epigrams with which
the book was strewn, forced both the religious and
the irreligious public to read, whether they would or
no. A storm of controversy rose round the volumes,
and some of the keenest observers of English life had
said at the time, and maintained since, that the publication
of the book had made or marked an epoch.</p>
</div>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">
<tbody><tr><td class="figcenter"><img alt="" src="images/img177.jpg" style="width:700px; height:479px" id="id-3347522529185671925"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">THE RECTORY OF PEPER HAROW</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page119"></a>119</span></p>
<p>Against the influence of such a book, and
more particularly against a growing intimacy
with its author, Robert Elsmere felt himself as
helpless as a child. The squire’s talk “was simply
the outpouring of one of the richest, most
skeptical, and most highly trained of minds on
the subject of Christian origins.” His two books
were, he said, merely an interlude in his life-work,
which had been devoted to an “exhaustive
examination of human records” in the preparation
of a great History of Testimony which
had required learning the Oriental languages
and sifting and comparing the entire mass of
existing records of classical antiquity—India,
Persia, Egypt, and Judea—down to the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Reference has already been made to the influence
of Professor Mark Pattison upon the early
life of Mrs. Ward. To create the Squire she had
only to imagine the house in the great park of
Peper Harow, equipped with a library like the
Bodleian, and inhabited by a person who might
be otherwise like any English squire, but in mental
equipment a duplicate to some extent of the
Rector of Lincoln. Professor Pattison’s father
was a strict evangelical. He gave his son a good
education, and the boy early manifested a delight
in literature and learning. He soon developed an
independence of character, and, refusing to confine
his reading to the prescribed books of orthodoxy,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120"></a>120</span>
delved into the classics extensively as well
as the English literature of Pope, Addison, and
Swift. He was graduated at Oxford in 1836, and
took his M.A. degree in 1840. By this time he
had abandoned the evangelical teachings of his
youth, and with other young men came under
the influence of Newman, in whose house he went
to live. When Newman went into the Roman
Catholic Church in 1845, Pattison was not so
much shocked as others. Indeed, he confessed
that he “might have dropped off to Rome himself
in some moment of mental and physical
depression or under pressure of some arguing
convert.” But Pattison, who was now a Fellow
at Lincoln College, was thoroughly devoted to
his work and was fast gaining a great reputation,
not only for his magnetic influence upon young
men, but as one of the ablest of college tutors
and lecturers. In 1861 he became Rector of Lincoln.
He was an indefatigable writer, contributing
to many magazines and to the “Encyclopædia
Britannica.” An article on “Tendencies of
Religious Thought in England, 1688-1750”
aroused widespread comment. His literary work
was marked by evidences of most painstaking research
coupled with a profound scholarship and
excellent judgment in the arrangement of his
material. He devoted a lifetime to the preparation
of a history of learning—a stupendous
undertaking of which only a portion was ever
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121"></a>121</span>
completed. He possessed a library said to be the
largest private collection of his time in Oxford.
It numbered fourteen thousand volumes, and was
extraordinarily complete in books on the history
of learning and philosophy in the sixteenth, seventeenth,
and eighteenth centuries. Of Professor
Pattison’s personality his biographer says:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>Under a singularly stiff and freezing manner to
strangers and to those whom he disliked he concealed
a most kindly nature, full of geniality and sympathy
and a great love of congenial and especially of female
society. But it was in his intercourse with his pupils
and generally with those younger than himself that he
was seen to most advantage. His conversation was
marked by a delicate irony. His words were few and
deliberate but pregnant with meaning and above all
stimulating, and their effect was heightened by perhaps
too frequent and, especially to undergraduates,
somewhat embarrassing flashes of silence.</p>
</div>
<p>All these qualities are continually appearing
in the Squire. But Professor Pattison’s own definition
of a man of learning is the best description
of Roger Wendover:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>Learning is a peculiar compound of memory, imagination,
scientific habit, accurate observation, all
concentrated through a prolonged period on the analysis
of the remains of literature. The result of this sustained
mental endeavor is not a book, but a man. It
cannot be embodied in print; it consists of the living
word.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page122"></a>122</span></p>
<p>The second in importance of the potent influences
upon Robert Elsmere’s character was that
of Henry Grey, a tutor of St. Anselm’s (Balliol
College), Oxford. Very early in his Oxford career
Elsmere was taken to hear a sermon by Mr. Grey,
which made a deep impression on his mind. The
substance of this sermon, which is briefly summarized
in the novel, was taken from a volume
of lay sermons by Professor Thomas Hill Green,
entitled “The Witness of God.”</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>The whole basis of Grey’s thought was ardently
idealist and Hegelian. He had broken with the popular
Christianity, but for him God, consciousness, duty,
were the only realities. None of the various forms of
materialist thought escaped his challenge; no genuine
utterance of the spiritual life of man but was sure of
his sympathy. It was known that, after having prepared
himself for the Christian ministry, he had remained
a layman because it had become impossible to
him to accept miracle; and it was evident that the
commoner type of Churchmen regarded him as an
antagonist all the more dangerous because he was so
sympathetic.</p>
</div>
<p>All of this, like all the other references to
Grey throughout the book, applies perfectly to
Professor Green. He was the leading exponent
at Oxford of the principles of Kant and Hegel,
and attracted many followers. His simplicity,
power, and earnestness commanded respect. He
associated with his pupils on terms of friendly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page123"></a>123</span>
intimacy, frequently taking some of them with
him on his vacations. He was a man of singularly
lofty character, and those who knew him were
reminded of Wordsworth, whom he resembled in
some ways.</p>
<p>When Elsmere is advised by his friend Newcome
to solve all the problems of his doubt by
trampling upon himself, flinging away his freedom,
and stifling his intellect, these words of
Henry Grey flash upon his mind:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>God is not wisely trusted when declared unintelligible.
Such honor rooted in dishonor stands; such
faith unfaithful makes us falsely true.</p>
<p>God is forever reason; and his communication, his
revelation, is reason.</p>
</div>
<p>The words are taken from the same volume of
Professor Green’s sermons.</p>
<p>The death of this dear friend of Robert Elsmere
occurred in 1882, and is most touchingly
described. An old Quaker aunt was sitting by
his bedside:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>She was a beautiful old figure in her white cap and
kerchief, and it seemed to please him to lie and look
at her. “It’ll not be for long, Henry,” she said to
him once. “I’m seventy-seven this spring. I shall
come to thee soon.” He made no reply, and his silence
seemed to disturb her.... “Thou’rt not doubting
the Lord’s goodness, Henry?” she said to him, with
the tears in her eyes. “No,” he said, “no, never. Only
it seems to be his will; we should be certain of nothing—<i>but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124"></a>124</span>
Himself</i>! I ask no more.” I shall never
forget the accent of these words; they were the breath
of his inmost life.</p>
</div>
<p>To understand the third of the three characters
from real life in “Robert Elsmere,” it is
necessary to glance at the story of Henri Frédéric
Amiel, a Swiss essayist, philosopher, and
dreamer, who was born in 1821 and died in
1881, leaving as a legacy to his friends a “Journal
Intime” covering the psychological observations,
meditations, and inmost thoughts of thirty
years. They represented a prodigious amount of
labor, covering some seventeen thousand folio
pages of manuscript. This extensive journal was
translated into English by Mrs. Ward and published
in 1883, five years before the date of
“Robert Elsmere.” Her long and exhaustive
study of the life of this extraordinary man as revealed
by himself made a deep impression upon
the mind of the novelist—so much so that she
could not refrain from introducing him in the
person of the morbid Langham. A brief glance
at some of the peculiarities of Amiel will prove
the best interpretation of Langham, without
which the latter must always remain a mystery.</p>
<p>Amiel’s estimate of the value of his life-work
was not a high one. “This Journal of mine,” he
said, “represents the material of a good many
volumes; what prodigious waste of thought, of
strength. It will be useful to nobody, and even
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125"></a>125</span>
for myself it has rather helped me to shirk life
than to practice it.” And again, “Is everything
I have produced taken together, my correspondence,
these thousands of journal pages, my lectures,
my articles, my poems, my notes of different
kinds—anything better than withered
leaves? To whom and to what have I been useful?
Will my name survive me a single day?
And will it ever mean anything to anybody? A
life of no account! When it is all added up,
nothing!”</p>
<p>“Amiel,” says Mrs. Ward, “might have been
saved from despair by love and marriage, by
paternity, by strenuous and successful literary
production.”</p>
<p>Family life attracted him perpetually. “I cannot
escape from the ideal of it,” he said. “A companion
of my life, of my work, of my thoughts,
of my hopes; within, a common worship—towards
the world outside, kindness and beneficence;
education to undertake; the thousand and
one moral relations which develop around the first—all
these ideas intoxicate me sometimes.”</p>
<p>But in vain. “Reality, the present, the irreparable,
the necessary, repel and even terrify me.
I have too much imagination, conscience, and
penetration, and not enough character. The life
of thought alone seems to me to have enough
elasticity and immensity to be free enough from
the irreparable; practical life makes me afraid.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page126"></a>126</span>
I am distrustful of myself and of happiness because
I know myself. The ideal poisons for me
all imperfect possession, and I abhor all useless
regrets and repentances.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Ward dramatized this strange individuality
in the character of Langham. The love-scene
in which Langham wins the hand of the
beautiful Rose, followed by the all-night mental
struggle in which he finally feels compelled to
renounce all that he has gained, is almost tragic
in its intensity.</p>
<p>Poor Langham, with the prize fairly within
his grasp, found that he lacked the courage to
retain it. And so the morning after the proposal,
instead of the pleasantly anticipated call from her
accepted lover, the unfortunate Rose was shocked
to receive a pessimistic letter announcing that
the engagement had not survived the night. To
the casual reader it would seem that such a man
as Langham would be impossible. But that Amiel
was just such a person his elaborate journal fully
reveals. And Professor Mark Pattison has given
his testimony that Amiel was not alone in his
experiences, for six months after the journal was
published he wrote, “I can vouch that there is
in existence at least one other soul which has
lived through the same struggles mental and
moral as Amiel.”</p>
<p>Among the very large number of persons who
come upon the stage in the action of this remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page127"></a>127</span>
book, several besides the Squire, Grey,
and Langham may have been suggested by persons
whom the author knew. But the prototypes
of these three are the only ones who really enter,
in a vital way, into the actual construction of the
novel. “But who was the real Elsmere?” one
naturally asks. Many attempts have been made
to identify this good preacher or that worthy reformer
with the famous character, much to the
annoyance of the author, who really created Elsmere
out of the influences already described. The
real Elsmere would be obviously one whose religious
views were moulded by Mark Pattison and
Thomas H. Green, and one who was profoundly
interested in, if not influenced by, the strange
self-distrust of Amiel. The real Elsmere would
be also one whose religious convictions led inevitably
to the desire to perform some practical
service to mankind. Such an Elsmere exists in
the person of Mrs. Ward herself, who is to-day
regarded by the workers and associates of the
Passmore Edwards Settlement, in Tavistock Place,
London, with very much the same love and gratitude
as Elsmere won from the people of Elgood
Street. For this beneficent institution was a direct
result of the novel, and owes its existence very
largely to Mrs. Ward’s energetic and influential
efforts.</p>

<p class="center pt2">III<br>
<span class="f90">OTHER PEOPLE AND SCENERY</span></p>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">“The</span> History of David Grieve,” Mrs. Ward’s
third novel, is by many considered, next to “Robert
Elsmere,” her greatest achievement. David
and his sister Louie are the orphan children
of a sturdy and high-minded Englishman whose
wife was a French woman of somewhat doubtful
character. Their development from early
childhood to full maturity is traced with a
power of psychological analysis seldom equaled.
Both are intensely human and fall easy prey to
the temptations of their environment, but in the
end David overcomes the evil influences, while
poor Louie, inheriting more of her mother’s
temperament, goes to her death in poverty and
disgrace.</p>
<p>The most attractive part of the book is the
opening, where the two children are seen roaming
the hills of the wild moorland country of
their birth. This is the Kinderscout region, in
Derbyshire, something over twenty miles southeast
of Manchester.</p>
<p>The visitor must take the train to Hayfield,
called Clough End in the novel, and then, if he
is fortunate enough to have permission from
the owner, may drive a distance of four or five
miles to what is now called Upper House, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page129"></a>129</span>
country home of a wealthy merchant of Manchester.
This was originally known as Marriott’s
Farm, and for several hundred years was owned
by a family of that name. Here Mrs. Ward
spent two days, when the entire house consisted
of what is now the right wing. She walked over
the moors and along the top of the Kinderscout
with Mr. Marriott as her guide, and thus obtained
the knowledge for the most perfect description of
pastoral life to be found in any of her novels.</p>
<p>Needham’s Farm, the home of David and
Louie, is the only other farm in the neighborhood.
It is now known as the Lower House,
and is owned by the same Manchester gentleman,
but is leased to a family named Needham,
who have occupied it for many years. It looks
now just as it did when Mrs. Ward described it.</p>
<p>The “Owd Smithy,” where the prayer-meeting
was held and Louie wickedly played the
ghost of Jenny Crum, is now only remotely
suggested by a heap of rocks bearing little resemblance
to a building of any kind. Huge mill-stones,
partly embedded in the earth, are scattered
about here and there. The Downfall,
which, when the water is coming over, is visible
for miles around, is ordinarily a bare, bleak pile
of rocks, for it is usually nearly if not quite dry.
But after a heavy rain the water comes over in
large volume, and, if the wind is strong, is blown
back, presenting a most curious spectacle of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130"></a>130</span>
cascade seeming to disappear in the air when
halfway to the bottom. Not far away is the
Mermaid’s Pool, haunted by the ghost of Jenny
Crum. There is a real ghost story connected with
this pool, which doubtless formed the basis of
Mrs. Ward’s legend. An old farmer named Tom
Heys was much troubled by a ghost, of which
he could not rid himself. He once shot at it,
but without effect except that the bullet-mark
is in the old house even now. An old woman
once saw the ghost while shearing sheep. She
threw the tongs at it. Instantly the room was
filled with flying fleece, while the woman’s clothes
were cut to pieces and fell off her body. These
were some of the troublesome pranks played by
the ghost. At length the farmer discovered, somewhere
on his place, an old skull, which doubtless
belonged to His Ghostship, and carried it to the
Mermaid’s Pool, where he deposited it</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“To stay as long as holly’s green,</p>
<p class="i05">And rocks on Kinderscout are seen.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>This effectually disposed of the ghost so far as
he was concerned, but the spirit still hovers over
the Mermaid’s Pool.</p>

<p>Market Place, Manchester, where we find David
after his flight from the old farm, looks to-day
very much the same. Half Street, however,
on the east of the cathedral, has disappeared.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page131"></a>131</span>
Purcell’s shop in this street was described from a
quaint little book-shop which actually existed at
the time.</p>
<p>The Parisian scenes of “David Grieve,” the
Louvre, the Boulevards, the Latin Quarter, Fontainebleau,
Saint-Germain, and Barbizon, are
all too well known to need mention here. The
final scenes of the novel, where David’s wife is
brought after the beginning of her fatal illness,
are in one of the most beautiful localities in the
English Lake District. Lucy’s house is supposed
to be on the right bank of the river. The house
is imaginary (the one on the left bank having
no connection with the story), but the location
is exactly described. This is just above Pelter
Bridge, a mile north of Ambleside, where the
river Rothay combines with the adjacent hills
to make one of those fascinating scenes for
which Westmoreland is famous. Nab Scar looms
up before us, and off to the left is Loughrigg.
A stroll along the river brings one to the little
bridge at the outlet of Rydal Water, where
David walked for quiet meditation during his
wife’s illness; and still farther northward the
larch plantations on the side of Silver How add
their touch of beauty to the landscape. This entire
region has always been dear to Mrs. Ward’s
heart from the associations of her girlhood, and,
if Lucy must die, she could think of no more
lovely spot for the last sad scenes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page132"></a>132</span></p>
<p>One character in “David Grieve” is drawn
from real life—Élise Delaunay, the French girl
with whom David falls in love on his first visit
to Paris. This is, in some respects, a portrait of
Marie Bashkirtseff, a young native of Russia,
whose brief career as an artist attracted much
notice. Marie was born of wealthy parents in
1860. When she was only ten years old her
mother quarreled with her husband and left him,
taking the children with her. Marie returned to
her father, with whom she traveled extensively.
A born artist, the journey through Italy created
in her a new and thrilling interest. She resolved
to devote her life to art, and in 1877 entered
the school of Julian in Paris. She soon showed
astonishing capacity, and Julian assured her that
her draughtsmanship was remarkable. One of
her paintings, “Le Meeting,” was exhibited in
the Salon of 1884, and attracted much notice.
Reproductions were made in all the leading papers,
and it was finally bought by the cousin of
the Czar, the Grand Duke Constantino Constantinowitch,
a distinguished connoisseur and himself
a painter. This picture represents half a dozen
street gamins of the ordinary Parisian type holding
a conference in the street. Their faces exhibit
all the seriousness of a group of financiers
consulting upon some project of vast importance.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of Marie’s character is set
forth by her biographer in words which enable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page133"></a>133</span>
the reader of “David Grieve” instantly to recognize
Élise Delaunay:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>She never wholly yields herself up to any fixed
rule of conduct, or even passion, being swayed this
way or that by the intense impressionability of her
nature. She herself recognized this anomaly in the
remark, “My life can’t endure; I have a deal too
much of some things and a deal too little of others,
and a character not made to last.” The very intensity
of her desire to see life at all points seems to defeat
itself, and she cannot help stealing side glances
at ambition during the most romantic tête-à-tête with
a lover, or being tortured by visions of unsatisfied
love when art should have engrossed all her faculties.</p>
</div>
<p>In the last year of her life Marie achieved an
admiration for Bastien-Lepage which, her biographer
says, “has a suspicious flavour of love
about it. It is the strongest, sweetest, most impassioned
feeling of her existence.” She died in
1884, at the early age of twenty-four, assured
by Bastien-Lepage that no other woman had ever
accomplished so much at her age.</p>
<p>“Marcella” and “Sir George Tressady” are
novels of English social and political life—a
field in which Mrs. Ward is peculiarly at home,
and in which she has no superior. Marcella, who
in her final development became one of the most
beautiful women of all Mrs. Ward’s characters,
was suggested by the personality of an intimate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page134"></a>134</span>
friend, whose name need not be mentioned. Mellor
Park, the home of Marcella, is drawn from
Hampden House in Buckinghamshire. It is a
famous old house, some centuries old, now the
country-seat of the Earl of Buckinghamshire,
and, with its well-kept gardens and spacious
park, is unusually attractive. Twenty years ago,
however, it was in a state of neglect. The road
leading to it was full of underbrush, the garden
was wholly uncared-for, and the house itself
much in need of repair. This is the state in
which Mrs. Ward describes it—and she knew
it well, for she had leased it for a season and
made it her summer home. The murder of the
gamekeeper, described as taking place near Mellor
Park, really happened at Stocks, Mrs. Ward’s
present home near Tring.</p>
<p>The village of Ferth, where Sir George Tressady
had his home and owned the collieries, is a
mining village ten miles from Crewe, known as
“Talk o’ the Hill.” The ugly black house to
which Tressady brought home his young wife
was described from an actual house which the
author visited.</p>
<p>“Helbeck of Bannisdale” was written while
the author was living at Levens Hall, the handsome
country home of Captain Bagot, M.P.,
which Mrs. Ward leased for a summer. It is a
few miles south of Kendal, in Westmoreland,
and just on the border of the “Peat Moss”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page135"></a>135</span>
country. The old hall dates back to 1170, the
original deed now in possession of Captain
Bagot bearing that date. The dining-room has
an inlaid design over the mantel with the date
1586. The entrance-hall, dining-room, and drawing-room
contain many antique relics. But the
most remarkable feature of Levens is the garden,
containing about two hundred yews trained
and trimmed into every conceivable shape. There
is an “umbrella” which has required two hundred
years of constant care to reach its present
size and shape; a British lion, with perfect coronet;
a peacock with correctly formed neck and
tail feathers; a barrister’s wig, a kaffir’s hut,
and so on through a long list of curious shapes.
In front of the house the river Kent, with a
bridge of two arches, makes a picturesque scene.
This is the “bridge over the Bannisdale River”
which marked the end of Laura’s drive with
Mason, where at sight of Helbeck the young
man made his sudden and unceremonious departure.
A spacious park skirts the river, through
which runs a grassy road bounded by splendid
oaks intertwining their branches high above.
Following this path we reached a foot-bridge
barely wide enough for one person to cross, on
the park end of which is a rough platform apparently
built for fishermen. Here Laura kept
her clandestine appointment with Mason, and on
her way home was mistaken for the ghost of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136"></a>136</span>
“Bannisdale Lady,” much to the terror of a
poor old man who chanced to be passing, and
not a little to her own subsequent embarrassment.
A little beyond is the deep pool where
Laura was drowned.</p>
<p>The exterior of Bannisdale Hall is not Levens,
but Sizergh Castle, some two or three miles
nearer Kendal. At the time of the story a
Catholic family of Stricklands owned the place,
but, like Helbeck, were gradually selling parts
of their property, and dealers from London and
elsewhere were constantly coming to carry off
furniture or paintings. The family finally lost
the property, and it was acquired by a distant
relative, Sir Gerald Strickland, who was recently
appointed Governor of New South Wales, and
who now owns but does not occupy it.</p>
<p>The little chapel, high up on a hill, where
Laura was buried, is at Cartmel Fell, in Northern
Lancashire. A quaint little chapel five or six
hundred years old, it is well worth a visit.</p>
<p class="pt1">The scenes of “Eleanor” are in Italy, and here
Mrs. Ward fairly revels in descriptions of “Italy,
the beloved and beautiful.” The opening chapters
have their setting in the Villa Barberini, on the
ridge of the Alban Hills, south of Rome, from the
balcony of which the dome of St. Peter’s can be
seen in the distance, dominating the landscape
by day and seeming at night to be the one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page137"></a>137</span>
thing which has definite form and identity.
There is a visit to Nemi and Egeria’s Spring,
after which the scene changes to the valley of
the Paglia, beyond the hill town of Orvieto, “a
valley with wooded hills on either side, of a bluish-green
color, checkered with hill towns and slim
campaniles and winding roads; and, binding it
all in one, the loops and reaches of a full brown
river.”</p>
<p>Torre Amiata—the real name of which is
Torre Alfina—is a magnificent castle, “a place
of remote and enchanting beauty.” Through
some Italian friends, Mrs. Ward met the agent
of this great estate, who put his house at her
disposal for a season. This happy opportunity
gave her the intimate acquaintance with the
surrounding country which she used with such
excellent skill in “Eleanor,” and enabled her,
among other things, to discover the ruined convent
and chapel which formed the dismal retreat
of Lucy and Eleanor in their strange flight
from Mr. Manisty.</p>
<p class="pt1">“Lady Rose’s Daughter,” which followed
“Eleanor,” likewise reflects the author’s love of
Italy. It was written, in part at least, in the
beautiful villa at Cadenabbia, on Lake Como,
from which a view of surpassing loveliness meets
the eye in every direction. Mrs. Ward never
tires of it, and in her leisure moments while there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page138"></a>138</span>
found great delight in reproducing in her sketch-book
the charming colors of a landscape which can
scarcely be equaled in any other part of the world.</p>
<p>The setting of the novel in its earlier chapters
is London. But when Julie Le Breton, worn out
by mental anguish, the result of experiences
which had nearly ruined her life, could be rescued
and brought back to life only by a quiet
rest amid pleasant surroundings, Lake Como was
the place selected by her kind-hearted little
friend the duchess. As her strength gradually
returned she daily walked over the hill to the
path that led to the woods overhanging the
Villa Carlotta.</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>Such a path! To the left hand, and, as it seemed,
steeply beneath her feet, all earth and heaven—the
wide lake, the purple mountains, the glories of a
flaming sky. On the calm spaces of water lay a shimmer
of crimson and gold, repeating the noble splendor
of the clouds.... To her right a green hillside—each
blade of grass, each flower, each tuft of heath,
enskied, transfigured by the broad light that poured
across it from the hidden west. And on the very hilltop
a few scattered olives, peaches, and wild cherries
scrawled upon the blue, their bare, leaning stems, their
pearly whites, their golden pinks and feathery gray,
all in a glory of sunset that made of them things enchanted,
aerial, fantastical, like a dance of Botticelli
angels on the height.</p>

<p>The story opens with a graphic description of
Lady Henry’s salon—frequented by the most
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page139"></a>139</span>
prominent people in London—where the chief
attraction was not the great lady herself, but her
maid companion, Julie Le Breton. Everywhere
Julie was met with smiles and evidence of eager
interest. She knew every one, and “her rule
appeared to be at once absolute and welcome.”
But one evening Lady Henry was ill and gave
orders that the guests be turned away with her
apologies. As the carriages drove up, one by
one, the footman rehearsed Lady Henry’s excuses.
But a group of men soon assembled in
the inner vestibule, and Julie felt impelled to
invite them into the library, where they were
implored not to make any noise. The distinguished
frequenters of Lady Henry’s salon were all there.
Coffee was served, and, stimulated by the blazing
fire and a sense of excitement due to the
novelty of the situation, an animated conversation
sprang up, which continued till midnight
and was at last suddenly interrupted by the unexpected
appearance of Lady Henry herself.</p>
<p>Lady Henry’s awakening led to Julie’s dismissal.
But her friends did not desert her. A
little cottage was found, where Julie was soon
comfortably installed.</p>
<p>This much of the story—and little if any
more—was suggested by the life of Julie de
Lespinasse, a Frenchwoman who figured brilliantly
in the Paris society of the middle of the
eighteenth century.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page140"></a>140</span></p>
<p>In 1754 the Marquise du Deffand was one of
the famous women of Paris. Her quick intelligence
and a great reputation for wit had brought
to her drawing-room the famous authors, philosophers,
and learned men of the day. But the
great lady, now nearly sixty, was entirely blind
and subject to a “chronic weariness that devoured
her.” She sought a remedy in the society
of an extraordinarily attractive young woman,
of somewhat doubtful parentage, named Julie
de Lespinasse, whom she took into her home as
a companion. Julie became a great social success.
For ten years she remained with Madame
du Deffand, when a bitter quarrel separated
them. Julie’s friends combined to assure her an
income and a home, and she was soon established
almost opposite the house of her former
patron. The Maréchale de Luxembourg presented
her with a complete suite of furniture.
Turgot, the famous Minister of Louis XVI, and
President Hénault were among those who provided
funds. D’Alembert, distinguished as a
philosopher, author, and geometrician, who was
the cause of the quarrel with the marquise, became
Julie’s most intimate friend. When she
founded her own salon, his official patronage
and constant presence assured its success. Her
success was, in fact, astonishingly rapid. “In the
space of a few months,” says her biographer,
the Marquis de Ségur, “the modest room with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page141"></a>141</span>
the crimson blinds was nightly filled, between
the hours of six and ten, by a crowd of chosen
visitors, courtiers and men of letters, soldiers
and churchmen, ambassadors and great ladies,
... each and all gayly jostling elbows as they
struggled up the narrow wooden stairs, unregretting,
and forgetting in the ardor of their
talk, the richest houses in Paris, their suppers
and balls, the opera, and the futile lures of the
grand world.”</p>
<p>The remarkable career and unique personality
of this famous woman furnished the suggestion
for Julie Le Breton. But beyond this the resemblance
is slight. The subsequent history of
the Frenchwoman has no relation to the story
of “Lady Rose’s Daughter,” and the personality
of the two women differs in many respects.</p>
<p class="pt1">“The Marriage of William Ashe” is like
“Lady Rose’s Daughter” in two important respects:
it is a story in which the author reveals
an extraordinary knowledge of English politics
and familiarity with the social life of the upper
classes, and it is one in which a story of real
life plays an important part. Indeed, there is far
more of real life in this novel than in any other
the author has written. William Ashe and his
frivolous and erratic wife Kitty are portraits, considerably
modified, it is true, but nevertheless
real, of William and Caroline Lamb. William
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142"></a>142</span>
Lamb—known to posterity as Lord Melbourne—did
not become a distinguished statesman
until after he had entered the House of Lords.
For twenty-five years he had been a member of
the House of Commons, of little influence and
almost unknown to the country at large. But
soon after the death of George IV he entered
the cabinet of Earl Grey as Home Secretary.
This was in 1830. Less than four years later he
rose suddenly to the highest position in the
state. As Premier it was his unique privilege to
instruct the young Queen, Victoria, in the duties
of her high office—a task which he executed
with commendable tact and skill. It is the
inconsequential William Lamb of the House of
Commons, and not the exalted Lord Melbourne,
whom Mrs. Ward had in mind in portraying
William Ashe; and it was more particularly his
young wife, Caroline Lamb, who furnished the
real motive of the novel.</p>
<p>“Lady Caroline,” we are told by Lord Melbourne’s
biographer, Dr. Dunckley, “became the
mistress of many accomplishments. She acquired
French and Latin, and had the further courage,
Mr. Torrens tells us, to undertake the recital of
an ode of Sappho. She could draw and paint, and
had the instinct of caricature. Her mind was
brimming with romance, and, regardless of conventionality,
she followed her own tastes in everything.
In conversation she was both vivacious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page143"></a>143</span>
and witty.” Such was Lady Caroline Ponsonby
when she married William Lamb. The marriage
proved an extremely unhappy one. Lady Caroline’s
whole life was a series of flirtations—deliberately
planned, as a matter of fact, and yet
entered upon with such mad rushes of passion as
to seem merely the result of some irresistible
impulse. A son was born to the couple, but he
brought no joy, for as he grew up he developed
an infirmity of intellect amounting almost to imbecility.
The life of the young people was “an
incessant round of frivolous dissipation.” The
after-supper revels often lasted till daybreak. But
this brought no happiness, and both husband and
wife came to realize that marriage had been, for
them, a troublesome affair. About this time Lord
Byron appeared on the scene. “Childe Harold”
had brought him sudden fame. He had traveled
in the East, was the hero of many escapades, had
been sufficiently wicked to win the admiration of
certain ladies of romantic tendencies, and altogether
created quite a <i>furor</i> through the peculiar
charms of his handsome face and dashing ways.
He sought and obtained an introduction to Lady
Caroline. He came to call the next day when she
was alone, and for the next nine months almost
lived at Melbourne House. They called each other
by endearing names, and exchanged passionate
verses. They were constantly together, and the
intimacy caused much scandalous comment. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page144"></a>144</span>
lasted until Byron became tired of it all, and announced
his intention of marrying. The marriage
to a cousin of Lady Caroline aroused the fierce
jealousy of the latter, who proceeded to perform
a little melodrama of her own, first trying to
jump out of a window and then stabbing herself—not
so deep that it would hurt—with a
knife.</p>
<p>Such escapades could have but one result.
There came a separation, of course; but some
traces of the early love remained in both, and
when Lady Caroline was dying, William Lamb
was summoned from Ireland. The final parting
was not without tender affection on both sides,
and William felt his loss deeply.</p>
<p>In this brief sketch the reader of Mrs. Ward’s
novel will recognize Kitty Ashe in every line.
The portraiture is very close. Cliffe takes the
place of Lord Byron without being made to resemble
him. But he serves to reveal the weakness
of Kitty’s character. Even Kitty’s mischievous
work in writing a book, which came near ruining
her husband’s career, was an episode in the life
of Caroline Lamb. She wrote a novel in which
Byron and herself were the principal characters,
and their escapades were paraded before the world

<p>Of Mrs. Ward’s later books there is little to
say, so far as scenes and “originals” are concerned.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page145"></a>145</span>
In “Fenwick’s Career” the little cottage
where the artist and his wife lived was in reality
the summer home of Mrs. Ward’s daughter
Dorothy. It stands on the slope of a hill near the
Langdale Pikes in Westmoreland, commanding a
view of surpassing loveliness.</p>
<p>In the “Testing of Diana Mallory” the scenery
is all taken from the country near Stocks, the
summer home of the novelist.</p>
<p>In “Daphne,” or “Marriage à la Mode,”
Mount Vernon, Washington, Niagara Falls, and
an imaginary English estate supply the necessary
scenery, and these are not described with real
interest, for the author, contrary to her usual
custom, is here writing with a fixed didactic purpose.
But a chapter incidentally thrown in reflects
the novelist’s impressions of a visit to the
White House as the guest of President Roosevelt—an
experience which interested her greatly.
In “the tall, black-haired man with the meditative
eye, the equal, social or intellectual, of any
Foreign Minister that Europe might pit against
him, or any diplomat that might be sent to
handle him,” it is easy to recognize Mr. Root.
Secretary Garfield is “this younger man, sparely
built, with the sane handsome face—son of a
famous father, modest, amiable, efficient.” Secretary
Taft, with whom, apparently, the distinguished
author did not really become acquainted,
is lightly referred to as “this other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page146"></a>146</span>
of huge bulk and height, the hope of a party,
smiling already a Presidential smile as he passed.”</p>
<p>It has been said of this book that it does an
injustice to America. But such was assuredly far
from the author’s intent. Mrs. Ward, who is one
of the keenest observers of English and European
public men, pays a high compliment in the
remark that “America need make no excuses
whatever for her best men.... She has evolved
the leaders she wants, and Europe has nothing
to teach them.” She is attacking the laxity of
the divorce laws in certain American States, and
in doing so is actuated by motives which every
high-minded American must applaud. The English
general who berates American institutions
is held up to ridicule, and the most agreeable
woman in the book—perhaps the only agreeable
one—is an American. Daphne, through whom
the author condemns the evil, is not a typical
American girl, but, with evident intent to avoid
offense, is made the daughter of a foreigner.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Mrs. Ward’s feelings toward
America are of the kindliest nature, and,
whatever may be said of the merits of “Marriage
à la Mode” as a work of fiction, in condemning
an abuse which nobody can defend she has performed
a real service.</p>

A TOUR OF THE ITALIAN LAKES</p>
<p class="noind"><span class="chap1 sc">We</span> caught our first glimpse of Maggiore
from a window in Stresa, late in the afternoon
of a charming day in early spring. In spite
of the lateness of the hour, with all the enthusiasm
of amateurs, we proceeded to make a photograph
of the charming scene. Ruskin was right
when he declared Maggiore to be the most beautiful
of all the Italian lakes;—at least, we felt
willing to admit this, even though we had not
yet seen the others. In the foreground were the
green lawns and white paths of a well-kept park,
skirting the lake; then a wide stretch of water,
roughened by the wind so that its surface, usually
smooth, was now dotted with whitecaps,
dancing and sparkling in the afternoon sun;
across the water to the left, the village of Pallanza,
pushing itself far out into the lake, and
thrown into strong relief by the high mountains
at its back; far away in the distance, the white-capped
summit of some Alpine range; and above
it all, the most beautiful of blue Italian skies.</p>
<p>We gazed long upon the scene, until the twilight
began to deepen. Soon two figures appeared
at the entrance to the park, one a woman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page150"></a>150</span>
in a green velvet gown, the other a man in a
long flowing mantle of the style peculiar to
Italy. They seemed in earnest conversation, now
approaching each other with vigorous but graceful
gestures, now falling back a step or two and
again advancing. The man would throw his
cloak over his left shoulder; then, when his
earnestness caused it to slip away, he would
throw it back again, repeating the movement
over and over. We could almost fancy overhearing
Lorenzo say:—</p>

<p class="noind">The little pantomime seemed all that was needed

<p>The Lago di Maggiore, known to the Romans
as Lacus Verbanus, is the westernmost as
well as the largest of three lovely lakes which
lie on the southern slope of the Alps, in an area
not greater than that of the State of Rhode
Island. The Lago di Como, or Lacus Larius, is
the easternmost of the group, while the Lago di
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151"></a>151</span>
Lugano, smaller, but not less beautiful, lies between
the other two.</p>
<p>There is a peculiar delicacy of beauty about
these lakes like an exquisitely tinted rosebud
or the perfume of apple blossoms. The ruggedness
of aspect common to most mountain lakes is
here lost in the soft luxuriance of the green
shores, the sparkling waters, and the rich blue
sky. The hills are lined with terraces of green
vineyards, interspersed with the pink of peach
and almond blossoms. Camellias and azaleas
brighten the gardens. Mulberry trees, olives, and
cypresses, mingling with their sturdy Northern
companions, the spruces and pines, cast their
varied foliage against the brown of the near-by
mountains. In the distance the snow-clad peaks
of the Alps interpose their white mantles between
the blue of the sky and the warmer tones
of the hillsides, while here and there picturesque
villages stand out on projecting promontories to
lend an additional gleam of whiteness to the landscape.</p>
<p>Mingling with the charm of all this natural
beauty and intensifying it are the atmosphere of
poetry and romance which one instinctively feels,
and the more tangible associations with history,
literature, science, art, and architecture which
are constantly suggested as one makes the tour
of the lakes.</p>
<p>In the morning we found our places on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page152"></a>152</span>
upper deck of the little steamer that makes a
zigzag journey through Maggiore. No sooner
had the boat started than we heard sweet strains
of music and a chorus of well-modulated male
voices. The night before we had had a miniature
play for our special benefit. Can it be possible
that now we are to have Italian opera?
They were only a party of native excursionists,
but we were genuinely sorry when they disembarked
at the next landing.</p>
<p>Leaving Stresa, famous as the home of Cavour,
when that great statesman was planning
the creation of a united Italy, we soon came in
sight of Isola Bella. As it lay there in the bright
sunlight, its green terraces and tropical foliage,
its white towers and arcaded walls reflected in
the blue waters of the lake, the snowy mountains
forming a distant background and a cloudless
blue sky surmounting the whole, we thought it
beautiful. But in this, it seems, our taste was at
fault, and while admiring we ought to have
been criticizing. It was like spending an evening
with genuine enjoyment at the theater, only
to find out the next morning from the critic of
the daily newspaper that the play was poor, the
acting only ordinary, and the applause merely
an act of generosity. Southey wrote of it, “Isola
Bella is at once the most costly and the most
absurd effort of bad taste that has ever been
produced by wealth and extravagance.” A more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page153"></a>153</span>
recent English writer condemns its “monstrous
artificialities.” He declares that “the gardens
are a triumph of bad taste,” and that “artificial
grottoes, bristling with shells, terrible pieces of
hewn stone, which it would be an offense to
sculpture to term statuary, offend the eye at
every turn.” Another says that it is “like a
Périgord pie, stuck all over with the heads of
woodcocks and partridges,” while some one else
thinks it “worthy the taste of a confectioner.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, our own distinguished
novelist, Mrs. Edith Wharton, found much to
be admired:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>The palace has ... one feature of peculiar interest
to the student of villa architecture, namely, the beautiful
series of rooms in the south basement, opening
on the gardens, and decorated with the most exquisite
ornamentation of pebble-work and sea-shells, mingled
with delicate-tinted stucco. These low-vaulted rooms,
with marble floors, grotto-like walls, and fountains
dripping into fluted conches, are like a poet’s notion
of some twilight refuge from summer heats, where
the languid green air has the coolness of water: even
the fantastic consoles, tables, and benches, in which
cool glimmering mosaics are combined with carved
wood and stucco painted in faint greens and rose-tints,
might have been made of mother-of-pearl, coral,
and seaweed for the adornment of some submarine
palace.</p>
</div>
<p>It was the fashion to admire the island before
it became the rule to condemn its artificiality.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page154"></a>154</span>
Bishop Burnet visited Maggiore in 1685, fourteen
years after the Count Vitaliano Borromeo
had transformed the island from a barren slate
rock into a costly summer residence. He thought
it “one of the loveliest spots of ground in the
world,” and wrote, “there is nothing in all Italy
that can be compared with it.” At a much later
time, Lord Lytton allowed himself to rise to the
heights of enthusiasm:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“O fairy island of a fairy sea,</p>
<p class="i2">Wherein Calypso might have spelled the Greek,</p>
<p class="i05">Or Flora piled her fragrant treasury,</p>
<p class="i2">Culled from each shore her zephyr’s wings could seek,—</p>
<p class="i3">From rocks where aloes blow.</p>
<p class="s">“Tier upon tier, Hesperian fruits arise:</p>
<p class="i2">The hanging bowers of this soft Babylon;</p>
<p class="i05">An India mellows in the Lombard skies,</p>
<p class="i2">And changelings, stolen from the Lybian sun,</p>
<p class="i3">Smile to yon Alps of snow.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>The charge of artificiality must be admitted.
A bare rock cannot be transformed into a thing
of beauty and escape the charge. The ten terraces
are a series of walls, built in the form of
a pyramid and covered with earth, transported
from the mainland at great expense. Orange
and lemon trees, amid a profusion of tropical
foliage, are thus made to wave their fragrant
branches in the face of Alpine snows. Is not
this worth while? The truth is that Lake Maggiore
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page155"></a>155</span>
is so rich in the kind of beauty which the
hand of Nature has provided that the creations
of man—the villas, the gardens, the vineyards,
the villages nestling close to the water’s edge,
and the pilgrimage churches high up on the
mountain-sides—seem only to accentuate the
charm.</p>
<p>The Isola dei Pescatori, or Island of the Fishermen,
lying near the “Beautiful Island,” forms
a striking contrast. If distance is needed to lend
enchantment and conceal the lavish expenditure
of wealth on the Isola Bella, it is needed still more
to hide the squalor and avoid the odor of the
poor fishermen’s island. Yet the latter, seen from
the steamer’s deck, is far more picturesque than
its more pretentious neighbor. The third of the
Borromean group is known as the Isola Madre.
It has seven terraces, surmounted by an unused
villa. Its gardens are full of roses, camellias, and
all kinds of beautiful plants, lemons, oranges,
myrtle, magnolia, and semi-tropical trees in great
profusion. Less popular than Isola Bella, it is
considered by many far more attractive.</p>
<p>Two villages lying farther south on the western
shore of the lake are worthy of at least passing
mention:—Belgirate and Arona. The former
was the home, in the late years of his life, of
the great master of Italian prose, Manzoni, whose
novel, “I Promessi Sposi,” was thought by Scott
to be the finest ever written. He was a man of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page156"></a>156</span>
the people, greatly beloved by his countrymen
for his benevolence, tender sympathy, and warmth
of affection. Arona was the home of the patron
saint of the Italian lakes, Carlo Borromeo. A
colossal statue, sixty-six feet high on a pedestal
of forty feet, built to his memory in 1697, is
one of the sights of the region. St. Charles was
born in 1537. At the age of twenty-three he
was made a cardinal by his uncle, Pope Pius IV.
Inheriting great wealth, he devoted his revenues
to charity, sometimes living on bread and water
and sleeping on straw. Traveling as a missionary,
he visited the remotest villages and almost inaccessible
shepherds’ huts high up on the mountains.
He is best remembered for his self-sacrifice
and heroic devotion to the people in the great
plague at Milan in 1575. But the great saint
was a hater of heretics and caused many of them
to be put to death. Nor was he without enemies
among those of his own faith. A Franciscan
monk once fired upon him, but he escaped as if
by miracle, the bullet glancing from the heavy
gold embroidery of his cope—a demonstration
that gold lace is not always a wholly superfluous
decoration.</p>
<p>Our little steamer zigzagged back and forth,
stopping at many villages, until finally Luino was
reached. This busy little town was the birthplace
of Bernardino Luini, the illustrious disciple
of Leonardo da Vinci, whose frescoes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page157"></a>157</span>
adorn many of the Italian churches. It was also
the scene of one of Garibaldi’s brave exploits,
though an unsuccessful one. Here we left the
steamer for a short ride by tramway to Ponte
Tresa, on Lake Lugano, where another little
boat was waiting. Although usually regarded as
one of the Italian lakes, the greater portion
of Lugano is in Swiss territory. Most tourists
make it the gateway from the north into Italy,
passing through its most populous town, Lugano,
which, with its neighbor, Paradiso, lines
the shores of a beautiful blue bay, guarded on
either side by high mountains, clothed with
groves of oak and chestnut set off by vineyards
and gardens on the lower slopes. To the front
Monte Caprino rises straight up from the water
like one huge, solitary rock, keeping stern watch
over the soft luxuriance of the towns. San Salvatore
is the sentinel on the right, while Monte
Bri and Monte Boglia are on duty at the left.
Lugano was the home of the Italian patriot,
Mazzini, who has been called the prophet of
Italian unity, as Garibaldi was its knight-errant
and Cavour its statesman.</p>
<p>On the eastern side of the lake and farther to
the south is Monte Generoso. We saw it only
from the steamer, but it ought to be seen at close
range, for it is covered with woods and pastures
and commands a view of the chain of lakes that
is said to be unsurpassed in all Italy. We maintained
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page158"></a>158</span>
our zigzag journey, however, until Porlezza
was reached, where another little train stood
ready to carry us over to Lake Como.</p>
<p>For kaleidoscopic revelations of Nature’s
choicest scenes and rarest beauties, the descent
from the highlands to the town of Menaggio could
scarcely be equaled. The train moved slowly
through the vineyards and gardens, gradually
descending, until with a sudden turn the whole
northern end of Como burst gloriously into view.
Never was sky a lovelier blue and never did water
more splendidly reflect its azure hue. Far away
the snowy Alps gave a touch of the sublime to
a view of surpassing grandeur. In a moment the
scene changed, and Bellagio with its white villas
stood before us, separating the two arms of the
lake. Then Varenna with its solitary tower, and
finally, at the edge of the water, the village of
Menaggio itself.</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p class="noind">So sang Wordsworth in the days of his youth.</p>
<p>Slowly winding our way down the precipitous
slopes, we reached at last the end of the railway,
and a third steamer closed the experiences of the
day by carrying us safely to Cadenabbia. “That
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page159"></a>159</span>
was Italy! and as lovely as Italy can be when she
tries.” So the poet Longfellow wrote to James
T. Fields in 1868. And every one who has been
there can appreciate the poet’s feeling when he
wrote:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p class="i2">Will it all vanish into air?</p>

<p class="i05">Sweet vision! Do not fade away;</p>
<p class="i2">Linger until my heart shall take</p>
<p class="i05">Into itself the summer day</p>
<p class="i2">And all the beauties of the lake.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Above Cadenabbia and reached by a winding
path through terraces of vineyards, there is a bit
of woods, made brilliant at this time of the spring
by a wealth of wild cherries, peaches, and almonds
in full blossom, and by the tall, luxuriant
growths of rhododendrons, now covered in thick
profusion with huge clusters of splendid pink
and purple blossoms. A shady spot near the
edge of the woods, where there was a table and
some chairs, made a convenient place where we
could rest after our climb, and view Longfellow’s
vision of “supreme and perfect beauty.” The
grand and majestic beauty of Maggiore and the
more modest but sweeter loveliness of Lugano
were but the preparation for the glorious, satisfying
perfection of Como, the most beautiful of
all the lakes, “a serene accord of forms and
colors.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page160"></a>160</span></p>
<p>Lake Como is famous, not alone for its beauty,
but for the many associations of history, science,
art, and literature. For centuries its shores have
been thickly set with costly villas—the homes of
wealth and luxury, and not infrequently of learning
and culture. The elder Pliny, whose habits
of industry were so great that he worked on his
prodigious “Natural History” even while traveling
at night in his carriage, was born at the city
of Como, as was also his gifted nephew. Volta, the
great physicist and pioneer in electrical science,
Pope Innocent III, and Pope Clement XIII were
all natives of the same place. The Cathedral of
Como is one of the most splendid in northern
Italy. The churches scattered all along the shores
of the lake, as well as the villas, are a delight
to students of art and architecture. They are
filled with paintings of great interest and valuable
works of sculpture.</p>
<p>Historically, although not conspicuous in the
great events of the world’s progress, the lake has
been the theater of many stirring scenes, particularly
in mediæval times. Halfway between
Menaggio and the northern end of the lake lies
a rocky promontory known as Musso, the site in
the sixteenth century of a great and almost impregnable
castle. It was the center of the activities
of one of the ablest, wickedest, and most
picturesque figures in the history of Italy. His
name was Gian Giacomo de Medici, although he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page161"></a>161</span>
was not related to the famous Florentine family.
He is best known by the name of “Il Medeghino.”
He is described as a man of medium
stature, broad-chested, and of pallid but good-humoured
countenance, and possessed of a keen
and searching glance. He was kind to his family
and possessed the affection of his soldiers; he
was temperate and not given to the indulgence
of the senses; and he gave liberally to charity
and to the encouragement of art. But he was a
murderer, traitor, liar, and all-round villain of the
first magnitude. If San Carlo Borromeo was the
patron saint of the Italian lakes, his uncle, Il
Medeghino, was their presiding demon. He began
his career at the age of sixteen by killing
another youth—an act for which he was banished
from Milan, but which became the stepping-stone
to a successful campaign of ambition,
based upon crime and bloodshed.</p>
<p>In those days of violence the capacity to do
murder was a recommendation, and Il Medeghino
soon rose to a position of power. He helped
Francesco Sforza, the last of that famous house,
to regain the Duchy of Milan by taking the life
of a French courier and stealing his documents,
for which services he demanded the Castle of
Musso. The price asked by the duke was another
murder, and the victim this time was a personal
friend and fellow soldier. Il Medeghino did not
hesitate, but brutally assassinated his friend. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page162"></a>162</span>
duke, no longer able to refuse, sent him to the
castle with a letter to the governor, ordering the
latter to turn the fortress over to the young adventurer,
but also with a sealed letter requesting
the governor to cut his throat. Il Medeghino
took no chances on the secret letter. He broke
the seal and destroyed this message, presenting
the open letter and obtaining possession of the
stronghold. Immediately he made his power felt.
He strengthened the walls of the fort and made
the cliffs inaccessible. He made himself feared
and his authority respected. He began a career
of piracy and plunder, continuing until he became
the master, not only of Lake Como, but of
Lugano and much of the adjacent territory. His
fleet of seven large ships and many smaller ones
swept the lake from end to end.</p>
<p>Although but thirty years of age, he was now
a power to be reckoned with. The Spaniards,
finding him dangerous and not to be conquered
by force, finally succeeded in winning him by
concessions. Charles V created him Marquis of
Musso and Count of Lecco, and induced him to
begin a vigorous warfare against his former
master, the Duke of Milan. But the end was
near. A great force of Swiss attacked from the
north and the Duke of Milan sent a large fleet
and great army to subdue the rebel. A battle off
Menaggio was lost by the pirate. He made a
desperate fight, but was compelled to yield to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page163"></a>163</span>
superior forces. But he nevertheless retired with
honors. He was given an enormous sum of money
and the title of Marquis of Marignano, together
with free pardon for himself and all his followers.
The rest of his days were spent in the service
of Spain. When he died, in his sixtieth year, his
brother, Pope Pius IV, erected a magnificent
tomb to his memory in the Cathedral of Milan,
where all who feel so disposed may pause to honor
this prince of pirates and most unscrupulous of
plunderers, conspicuous for his wickedness, even
in an age ruled by violence.</p>
<p>It is a relief to turn from the history of one
of the wickedest of men to that of one of the
noblest of women, by merely crossing the lake to
the village of Varenna—a town known to tourists
for its milk-white cascade, the Fiume Latte,
a waterfall which leaps in spring-time from a
height of a thousand feet. Here the remnant of
the castle of the good Queen Theodelinda may
still be seen.</p>
<p>In the sixth century <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, the Langobards, or
Long-Beards, taking advantage of the weakness
and desolation following the long wars against
the Goths, descended into Italy to take possession
of the land. A powerful race of Teutons,
renowned for daring and love of war, they met
with little resistance. Their king, soon after, met
a tragic death at the hands of his wife, and his
successor reigned only two years. After ten years
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page164"></a>164</span>
of experiments with a national confederacy, composed
of some thirty-five dukes, constantly at war
with each other, and resulting in a condition of
anarchy, the first real king of the Lombards was
chosen, Authari the Long-haired, known also by
his Roman name of Flavius. The chief event in
the life of this monarch was his courtship and
marriage. Having decided, probably for reasons
of state, upon the daughter of Garibald, Duke of
Bavaria, as his future wife, he sent ambassadors
to arrange the union. But becoming possessed of
a strange and unaccountable desire to catch a
glimpse of the lady before taking the final step,
he is said to have accompanied his messengers
in disguise. Fortunately for the romance of the
incident, he was charmed with her beauty while
the princess promptly fell in love with him.</p>
<p>The Christian Theodelinda became the honored
queen of the Lombards and so won the confidence
of their leaders that after the death of Authari,
shortly after their marriage, she was invited to
choose her own husband, who would thereupon
become the king. She chose Agilulf, Duke of
Turin. Through the influence of Theodelinda,
the Lombards were brought into the Catholic
Church, and the queen herself built at Monza the
first Lombard cathedral. Pope Gregory the Great
is said to have recognized her services by sending
her a precious relic, one of the nails of the
Cross, wrought into a narrow band or fillet of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165"></a>165</span>
iron. Sometime later, probably in the twelfth century,
this ancient relic, combined with a broad
band of gold set with many jewels, was converted
into the celebrated Iron Crown of Lombardy, with
which the German Emperors in mediæval times
were crowned Kings of Italy. It was used at the
coronation of Napoleon at Milan in 1805, and by
the present King of Italy upon his accession.
Theodelinda’s name was held in reverence by her
people, not only for her great public and private
charities, but for her kindliness of heart. The
castle at Varenna is said to have been her home
during the last years of her life.</p>
<p>If this story of the Larian Lake, to use its
Roman name, is being told backwards, it is because
we first saw it at the northern end, where
the interest centers in the events of the Middle
Ages. But having jumped from the sixteenth
back to the sixth century, it requires no greater
agility to skip a few more hundreds of years until
we get back to the time of Julius Cæsar, who
as governor of Cisalpine Gaul sent five thousand
colonists to the shores of the lake to protect the
region against the depredations of the Gauls.
Five hundred of them settled at the ancient town
of Comum. The city never played an important
part in the history of Rome, but remained a comparatively
quiet yet prosperous municipality.</p>
<p>In the Golden Age of Rome, the shores of
the Lacus Larius became lined with costly villas,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166"></a>166</span>
where wealthy men sought a retreat from the too
strenuous life of the Imperial City. The need
of such a refuge must be apparent to any one
having even the most superficial knowledge of
Roman municipal life in the first century of the
Christian era. To escape the corruption of official
life, the endless feasts of extravagance and immorality,
and even the public amusements, where,
as in the Flavian amphitheater, 87,000 people
were wont to gather to witness vast spectacles
of cruelty, obscenity, and bloodshed, there was
need enough, and the moral, self-respecting, and
refined people of Rome fully realized it. For
there were such people, though the fact has been
obscured by history, which has to deal chiefly
with the excesses of the ruling classes.</p>
<p>The two Plinys and their friends were brilliant
examples of the Romans of the better sort.
Though an aristocrat, Pliny the younger was a
charitable, good-natured man, who loved the quiet
of a home where he could combine study with
fishing, hunting, and the companionship of congenial
friends. He possessed several villas on the
shores of Como, but two particularly interested
him, one of which, in a somewhat whimsical letter,
he called “Tragedy” and the other “Comedy”;
the high boot worn by tragedians suggesting
the name of the one on a high rock over
the lake, while the sock or slipper of the comedian
applied to the villa down by the water’s edge.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page167"></a>167</span>
The latter had the great advantage that one might
fish from his bedroom, throwing the line out
of the window while he lay in bed. Pliny does
not tell how many fish he caught under these
conditions.</p>
<p>The Villa Pliniana, just above Torno, on the
eastern side of the lake, was built in 1570 by
Count Giovanni Anguisola, whose claim to distinction
lies in his participation in the murder of
Pierluigi Farnese. The villa was erected as a safe
retreat, where he might escape vengeance. Its
feature of greatest interest is a curious stream
which flows through the central apartment of
the house. Fifteen centuries before the villa was
constructed, Pliny described this stream in one
of his most interesting letters. “A certain spring,”
he writes, “rises in a mountain and runs down
through the rocks till it is inclosed in a small
dining-parlor made by hand; after being slightly
retarded there, it empties itself into the Larian
lake. Its nature is very remarkable. Three times
a day it is increased or diminished in volume by
a regular rise and fall. This can be plainly seen,
and when perceived is a source of great enjoyment.
You recline close to it and take your food
and even drink from the spring itself (for it is
remarkably cold): meanwhile with a regular and
measured movement, it either subsides or rises.
If you place a ring or any other object on the
dry ground it is gradually moistened and finally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page168"></a>168</span>
covered over: then again it comes to view and
is by degrees deserted by the water. If you watch
long enough you will see both of these performances
repeated a second and even a third time.”</p>
<p>Another famous villa at the southern end of
the lake, near the city of Como, was erected by
Cardinal Gallio, the son of a fisherman, who
achieved high honors in his Church and amassed
great wealth. This villa was later the home of
the discarded Queen Caroline, wife of George IV,
who gave it the name of Villa d’Este and made
great additions to its elegance. It is now a fashionable
hotel. Cardinal Gallio seems to have had
a passion for extensive villas. His palace at Gravedona,
at the head of the lake, was one of the most
splendid in Europe. It is said that he could make
the journey to Rome, requiring six days, and stop
at one of his own palaces every night.</p>
<p>The Villa Carlotta now the property of the
Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, is at Tremezzo, a village
adjoining Cadenabbia on the south. Its chief
beauty lies in the garden, filled with a profusion
of plants of every variety—roses, camellias,
azaleas, magnolias, oranges, lilies—all arranged
in charming walks, with here and there a vista
of the lake and Bellagio in the distance, reflecting
the bright sunlight from its white walls.
Above are the woods and the little round table
overlooking the water, where we began our survey
of the Larian shores. The interior contains
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page169"></a>169</span>
a large collection of sculptures, but most visitors
remember only two pieces,—Thorwaldsen’s
“Triumphant Entry into Babylon of Alexander
the Great,” and Canova’s lovely “Cupid and
Psyche.”</p>
<p>After seeing some of these palaces merely as
tourists, and learning the history of others of an
earlier day, particularly the homes described by
Pliny, we could not help wishing to see an Italian
palace which is not a show place but a home, and
typical of modern life on the shores of this wonderful
lake, for so many centuries sought by men
of wealth as the place where they could realize
their dreams of comfort and delight.</p>
<p>The opportunity of gratifying this desire came
sooner than we expected. We had started one
morning to make a call at the summer home of
Mrs. Humphry Ward, who had leased the Villa
Bonaventura for a season. Mistaking the directions,
we entered the gate of the Villa Maria, a
large house in the classical lines of the Italian
Renaissance, standing high above the road and
reached by winding paths through a garden of
surpassing loveliness. Our ring was answered by
the Italian butler, who in response to our inquiries
nodded pleasantly, not understanding a
word we said, and disappeared. In a few moments
we were most cordially greeted by an
American gentleman, who assured us he was
delighted to see us, and would be happy to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page170"></a>170</span>
show us the villa. In another moment, and before
we could make explanations, another ring
of the doorbell announced two other callers, who,
as it happened, were really expected at the hour
of our arrival, by invitation to see the villa. We
had made a mistake, and in turn had been mistaken
for two other people, but our friendly host
insisted that we, too, should see his beautiful
home.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">THE ATRIUM OF THE VILLA MARIA</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>We were standing in the atrium before a large
marble vase—a restoration of the so-called Gaeta
vase, by Salpion, a Greek sculptor of the time of
Praxiteles. The original was thrown into the Bay
of Gaeta, where for centuries it remained partially
embedded in the mud. The fishermen of
many generations used it as a convenient post
for mooring their boats, and did much damage
with their ropes. It was finally rescued and taken
to a church for use as a baptismal font, and later
transferred to the Naples Museum. The theme
of the vase is the presentation of the infant
Bacchus, by Mercury, to one of the Nymphs—a
favorite subject with ancient sculptors. Mr.
Haines, our courteous host, was justly proud of
this—the first complete restoration of this beautiful
work of art. The decoration of the atrium,
including the eight lunettes, as well as of the
entire villa, are by the hand of Pogliaghi, who
now stands at the head of the Lombard decorators.
He is the young sculptor who in 1895 was commissioned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page171"></a>171</span>
to design the magnificent bronze doors
of the Cathedral of Milan, a work requiring seven
years.</p>
<p>One striking feature of the villa is its harmony
of color. Glance out the doorway, from the
atrium across the lake, or from the dining-room
toward Menaggio, or through the library windows
into the garden, and everywhere you see
the blue Italian sky, the brown of the distant
mountains, the green of the freshly budding
trees, the sparkle of the lake, and the brilliant
tints of the camellias, hyacinths, and cineraria,
combining to make a scene of splendor rarely
equaled in this good old world of ours. Then,
glancing back into the rooms of the villa, you find
the same tints and shadings in the walls and ceilings,
the paintings, tapestries, and upholstery.
Perfect harmony with Nature at her best seems
to have been Pogliaghi’s motive.</p>
<p>Passing to the right of the atrium, we entered
the music saloon, decorated and furnished in the
style of Louis XIV, a large and beautiful room,
noteworthy, not only for its acoustic properties,
but also for extreme richness and harmony of
design and color. An arched opening reveals a
portion of a fine piece of tapestry by Giulio
Romano, dating from the sixteenth century,
which covers the rear wall of the dining-room.
This tapestry, formerly owned by the Duke of
Modena, is a representation of the old Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page172"></a>172</span>
legend of the presentation of Bacchus, the same
theme as that of the Gaeta vase. Indeed, it was
the possession of this tapestry which suggested
to Mr. Haines the idea of obtaining a restoration
of the famous vase. A striking feature of the
dining-room is the frieze of Poliaghi representing
young Bacchantes in the midst of fruit and
flowers, so cleverly painted that it seems to be
done in high relief, completely deceiving the eye.</p>
<p>On the left of the atrium is the library, with
two life-size portraits by De La Gandara, one of
Mr. Haines and the other of his wife. Mrs.
Haines was an accomplished musician as well as
an enthusiastic collector of works of art. The
Villa Maria was designed by her as a fitting
shrine for her valuable collections as well as with
a view to musical entertainments. Since her death,
in 1899, Mr. Haines, with equal enthusiasm and
taste, has added to the collections and improved
the villa. His study is in the rear of the library.
Its distinguishing feature is a life-size portrait
of the children of Catherine de Medici, by Federico
Zuccheri. This painting is seven hundred
years old, but the colors are still fresh, and although
life-size it has the exactness of a miniature.
It was formerly in the Borghese collection.</p>
<p>Ascending the marble stairway we were ushered
into the “Porcelain” room, containing the
most unique and valuable portion of the art
treasures of the villa. There are four cabinets
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page173"></a>173</span>
in the style of Louis XV, containing what is
probably the best collection to be found in Europe
of rare Ancienne, Porcelain de Saxe, Old
Chelsea, Nymphenberg, Dresden, Meissen, Ludwigsburg,
and Sèvres pieces in endless variety
and bewildering richness of design. There are
fans painted by Nicolas Poussin, and others by
French and Italian artists of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. There is a fine portrait of
the Duchess de Chevreuse by La Guillière and
an original painting of Louis le Grand by Le
Fèvre. A rare clock of the period of Louis XV,
made about 1750, with miniature allegorical
paintings, surrounded by pearls, stands upon a
Louis XIV desk, ornamented with elaborate carved
bronzes by Reisinger. On either side of the clock
is a fine old Bohemian vase, while near by is a
miniature of Napoleon by Isabey. The decoration
of the room is completed by a fine old piece
of Gobelin tapestry, bearing the signature of
Boucher and the date 1747, originally presented
by Louis XV to one of the queens of Spain.</p>
<p>These are a few of the treasures shown to us
in a very brief visit to the Villa Maria. The
enthusiasm of its owner for art goes hand in
hand with a love of nature. If the interior decorations
have been done with the eye of a discriminating
artist, no less has the exterior received
the same careful attention. The fine fountain,
just within the gates, the flower-beds with their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page174"></a>174</span>
well-harmonized tints, the olives and cypresses,
the camellias, the cherry tree in full blossom, all
add their charm to a view which would be unsurpassed
even without their aid. For the villa
is situated at one of the loveliest points on beautiful
Como, commanding on all sides a panorama
of distant mountains, with here and there a snow-capped
peak, of peaceful water glistening in the
warm April sun, of little white villages dotting
the shores of the lake, of quaint little chapels in
nooks and corners of the mountains, of peach
trees and almonds adding a touch of pink to the
landscape, of blue skies and fleecy clouds surmounting
the whole like a brilliant canopy. No
wonder that our genial host, after showing all
the beauties of his palace, stood by the open
window and waving his hand exclaimed, “I call
this my J. M. W. Turner.” But the window
framed a lovelier work of art than the hand of
man will ever paint.</p>

LITERARY LANDMARKS OF NEW ENGLAND</p>
<p class="noind"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> quest for literary landmarks is always a
fascinating pursuit, particularly to the amateur
photographer who likes to take pictures that
mean something. I have always found a certain
exhilaration in seeing for myself and reproducing
photographically the places made memorable
by some favorite author. To look into the ground
glass of my camera and see the reflected image
of some lovely scene that has been an inspiration
to poet or novelist, is like suddenly coming into
possession of a prize that had ever before been
thought unattainable. It brings the author of a
by-gone generation into one’s own time. It deepens
the previous enjoyment—makes it more
real. When I stand before the house in which
some great author has lived, I seem to see more
than a mere dwelling. The great man himself
comes out to meet me, invites me in, shows me
his study, presents me to his wife and children,
walks with me in his garden, tells me how the
surroundings of his home have influenced his
literary work, and finally sends me away with a
peculiar sense of intimacy. I go home, reach
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page178"></a>178</span>
out my hand for a certain neglected book on my
shelves, and lo! it opens as with a hidden
spring, a new light glows upon its pages, and
I find myself absorbed in conversation with a
friend.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page179"></a>179</span></p>
<p class="center pt2">I<br>
<span class="f90">CONCORD</span></p>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">For</span> this kind of hunting I know of no better
place in America than New England, and no
better town in which to begin than the sleepy
old village of Concord, twenty miles northwest
of Boston. On the occasion of a recent visit, we
walked out Monument Street and made our first
stop at a point in the road immediately opposite
the “Old Manse.” A party of school-children
were just entering. Had we been looking at the
grove on the hillside, at the opposite end of the
town, where Hawthorne used to walk to and fro,
composing the “Tanglewood Tales,” we might
have supposed they had come to catch a few
echoes of the famous story-teller’s voice, and I
should have made a photograph with the children
in it. But here they did not seem so appropriate,
and we waited until they had gone. When
all was quiet again, it did not require a very
vigorous imagination to look down the vista of
black-ash trees seen between the “two tall gate-posts
of rough-hewn stone,” and fancy a man
and woman walking arm in arm down the avenue
toward the weather-stained old parsonage, its
dark sides scarcely visible beneath the shadows
of the overarching trees. The man is of medium
height, broad-shouldered, and walks with a vigorous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page180"></a>180</span>
stride, suggesting the bodily activity of a
young athlete. His hair is dark, framing with wavy
curves a forehead both high and broad. Heavy
eyebrows overhang a pair of dark blue eyes, that
seem to flash with wondrous expressiveness, as
he bends slightly to speak to the little woman
at his side. His voice is low and deep, and she
responds to what he is saying with an upward
glance of her soft gray eyes and a happy smile
that clearly suggest the sunshine which she is
destined to throw into his life.</p>
<p>Thus Nathaniel Hawthorne and Sophia Peabody,
his bride, on a day in July, 1842, passed
into the gloomy old house where they were to
begin their honeymoon. I say “begin” because
it was not like the ordinary honeymoon that ends
abruptly on the day the husband first proposes
to go alone on a fishing excursion. Nor was it
like that of a certain “colored lady” whom I
once knew. On the day following the wedding
she left William to attend to his usual duties
in the stable and the garden while she started
on a two weeks’ “honeymoon” trip to her old
Virginia home, explaining afterward that she
“couldn’t afford to take dat fool niggah along,
noway.”</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">THE OLD MANSE</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The Hawthorne honeymoon was one of that
rare kind which begins with the wedding bells
and has no ending. They were married lovers
all their days. Hawthorne had seen enough of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page181"></a>181</span>
solitariness in his bachelorhood to appreciate
the rare companionship of his gifted wife, and
he wanted nothing more. The dingy old parsonage
was a Paradise to them and the new
Adam and Eve invited no intrusions into their
Eden. Some of their friends came occasionally,
it is true, but Hawthorne records that during
the next winter the snow in the old avenue was
marked by no footsteps save his own for weeks at
a time. And his loving wife, though she had come
from the midst of a large circle of friends, found
only happiness in sharing this solitude.</p>
<p>During the three years in which Hawthorne
lived in this “Old Manse,” he seldom walked
through the village, was known to but few of
his neighbors, never went to the town-meeting,
and not often to church, though he lived in a
house that had been built by a minister and occupied
by ministers so long that “it was awful
to reflect how many sermons must have been
written there.”</p>
<p>Let us peep through the windows of the parlor
at the end of the dark avenue and indulge
in another flight of fancy. It is an unusual day
at the Manse, for two visitors have called to
greet the new occupant. The elder of the two, a
man in his fortieth year, is Ralph Waldo Emerson,
who lives in the other end of the town in a
large, comfortable, and cheery house, which we
expect to see a little later. He knows the Old
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page182"></a>182</span>
Manse well. His grandfather built it shortly before
the outbreak of the Revolution and witnessed
the battle of Concord from a window in
the second story. This good man, who was the
Revolutionary parson of the village, died in
1776 at the early age of thirty-three, and a few
years later his widow married the Reverend Ezra
Ripley, who maintained, for more than sixty
years, the reputation of the Manse as a producer
of sermons, being succeeded by his son, Samuel,
also a minister. In October, 1834, Emerson
came there with his mother and remained a year,
during which he wrote his first, and one of his
greatest essays, “Nature.”</p>
<p>The other visitor is Henry D. Thoreau, a
young man of twenty-five, then living with the
Emersons. The two guests and their host are
sitting bolt upright in stiff-backed chairs. The
host speaks scarcely a word except to ask, for
the sake of politeness, a few formal questions,
which Thoreau answers with equal brevity. Emerson
alone talks freely, but his words, however
much weighted with wisdom, are those of a
monologuist and do not beget conversation. Yet
there is something in the manner of all three
that seems to betray the unspoken thought.
Hawthorne’s observing eyes seem to be saying,
“So this is Emerson, the man who, they say, is
drawing all kinds of queer and oddly dressed
people to this quiet little village,—visionaries,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page183"></a>183</span>
theorists, men and women who think they have
discovered a new thought, and come to him
to see if it is genuine. Perhaps he might help
solve some of my problems. What a pure, intellectual
gleam seems to be diffused about him!
With what full and sweet tones he speaks and
how persuasively! How serene and tranquil he
seems! How reposeful, as though he had adjusted
himself, with all reverence, to the supreme
requirements of life! Yet I am not sure I can
trust his philosophy. Let me admire him as a
poet and a true man, but I shall ask him no
questions.”</p>
<p>Then while Thoreau is talking, Emerson gazes
at Hawthorne and reflects: “This man’s face
haunts me. His manner fascinates me. I talk to
him and his eyes alone answer me; and yet this
seems sufficient. He does not echo my thoughts.
He has a mind all his own. He says so little that
I fear I talk too much. Yet he is a greater man
than his words betray. I have never found
pleasure in his writings, yet I cannot help admiring
the man. Some day I hope to know him better.
I have much to learn from him.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Hawthorne’s gaze has turned upon
the younger visitor. “What a wild creature he
seems! How original! How unsophisticated!
How ugly he is, with his long nose and queer
mouth. Yet his manners are courteous and even
his ugliness seems honest and agreeable. I understand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page184"></a>184</span>
he drifts about like an Indian, has no
fixed method of gaining a livelihood, knows
every path in the woods and will sit motionless
beside a brook until the fishes, and the birds,
and even the snakes will cease to fear his presence
and come back to investigate him. He is
a poet, too, as well as a scientist, and I am sure
has the gift of seeing Nature as no other man
has ever done. Some day I must walk with him
in the woods.”</p>
<p>Every man in the room loves freedom, and
hates conventionalities. The ordinary formalities
of polite society are unendurable. Therefore the
four walls seem oppressive and the straight-back
chairs produce an agonizing tension of the
nerves. They are all glad when the call is over.</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">

<p>Now let the scene change. It is winter and
the river behind the house is frozen. In the
glory of the setting sun, its surface seems a
smooth sea of transparent gold. The edges of
the stream are bordered with fantastic draperies,
hanging from the overarching trees in strange
festoons of purest white. Once more our three
friends appear, but the four walls are gone and
the wintry breeze has blown away all constraint.
All three lovers of the open air are now on skates.
Thoreau circles about skillfully in a bewildering
series of graceful curves, for he is an expert at
this form of sport and thinks nothing of skating
up the river for miles in pursuit of a fox or other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page185"></a>185</span>
wild creature. Emerson finds it harder; he leans
forward until his straight back seems to parallel
the ice and frequently returns to the shore to
rest. Hawthorne, if we may recall the words of
his admiring wife, moves “like a self-impelled
Greek statue, stately and grave,” as though acting
a part in some classic drama, yet fond of
the sport and apparently indefatigable in its
pursuit.</p>
<p>Once more let the scene change. Summer has
come again. The icy decorations have given
place to green boughs and rushes and meadow-grass
which seem to be trying to crowd the river
into narrower quarters. A small boat is approaching
the shore in the rear of the old house. In
the stern stands a young man who guides the
craft as though by instinct. With scarcely perceptible
motions of the single paddle, he makes
it go in whatsoever direction he wills, as though
paddling were only an act of the mind. The boat
is called the Musketaquid, after the Indian name
of the river. Its pilot, who is also its builder,
quickly reaches the shore, and we recognize the
man of Nature, Thoreau. Hawthorne, who has
been admiring both the boat and steersman, now
steps aboard and the two friends are soon moving
slowly among the lily-pads that line the
margin of the river. Hawthorne is rowing. He
handles the oars with no great skill, and as for
paddling, it would be impossible for him to make
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page186"></a>186</span>
the boat answer <i>his</i> will. Thoreau plucks from
the water a white pond-lily, and remarks that
“this delicious flower opens its virgin bosom to
the first sunlight and perfects its being through
the magic of that genial kiss.” He says he has
“beheld beds of them unfolding in due succession
as the sunrise stole gradually from flower to
flower”; and this leads Hawthorne to reflect
that such a sight is “not to be hoped for unless
when a poet adjusts his inward eye to a proper
focus with the outward organ.” We fancy that
under these conditions their talk “gushed like
the babble of a fountain,” as Hawthorne said it
did when he went fishing with Ellery Channing.</p>
<p>But we must not linger at the gate of the Old
Manse indulging these dreams, for we have other
pleasures in store. A hundred yards beyond, we
turn into the bit of road, at right angles with
the highway, now preserved because it was the
scene of the famous Concord fight. A beautiful
vista is made by the overarching of trees that
have grown up since the battle, and in the distance
we see the Monument, the Bridge, and the
“Minute Man.” The Monument marks the spot
where the British soldiers stood and opened fire
on the 19th of April, 1775, while the “Minute
Man” stands at the place where the Americans
received their order to return the fire. The
Monument was dedicated on the sixty-first anniversary
of the battle, Emerson offering his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page187"></a>187</span>
famous “Concord Hymn,” the opening stanza
of which, thirty-nine years later, was carved on
the pedestal of the Minute Man, erected in commemoration
of the centennial of the event:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“By the rude bridge that arched the flood,</p>
<p class="i2">Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled,</p>
<p class="i05">Here once the embattled farmers stood,</p>
<p class="i2">And fired the shot heard round the world.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p class="noind">The bridge is of no significance. It is a recent
structure of cement, the wooden bridge over
which the Minute Men charged having disappeared
more than a century ago.</p>
<p>Hawthorne took little interest in the battlefield,
though he did express a desire to open the
graves of the two nameless British soldiers, who
lie buried by the roadside, because of a tale that
one of them had been killed by a boy with an
axe—a fiendish yarn which we may be glad is
not authenticated. The great romancer confessed
that the field between the battlefield and his
house interested him far more because of the
Indian arrow-heads and other relics he could
pick up there—a trick he had learned from
Thoreau.</p>
<p>On our way back to the village we made a turn
to the left, for a visit to Sleepy Hollow Cemetery.
Never was such a place more appropriately named.
An elliptical bowl, bordered by grassy knolls,
with flowering shrubs and green groves, forms a
perfect cradle among the hills in which sleep
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page188"></a>188</span>
generation after generation of the inhabitants
of old Concord. On the opposite side of the hollow,
well up the slope of the hill and shaded by
many trees, we came to the graves of the Emersons,
the Thoreaus, and the Hawthornes, in neighborly
proximity. The Emerson grave seemed eminently
satisfactory. A rough-hewn boulder at
the foot of a tall pine marks the resting-place of
a strong, sincere, and unpretentious character,
who lived close to Nature. By his side lies Lidian,
his wife, with an inscription on her tombstone,
which few, perchance, stop to read, but which
ought to be read by all who can appreciate this
rare tribute to a woman’s worth:—</p>
<p class="center ptb1 f90">
    In her youth an unusual sense of<br>
  the Divine Presence was granted her<br>
      and she retained through life<br>
  the impress of that high Communion.<br>
    To her children she seemed in her<br>
  native ascendancy and unquestioning<br>
      courage, a Queen, a Flower in<br>
        elegance and delicacy.<br>
  The love and care for her husband and<br>
    children was her first earthly interest<br>
      but with overflowing compassion<br>
    her heart went out to the slave, the sick<br>
  and the dumb creation. She remembered<br>
them that were in bonds as bound with them.</p>
<p>Thoreau’s grave is not quite so satisfactory.
It creates the impression that the poet and naturalist
who brought fame to his family was only
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page189"></a>189</span>
one of a considerable number of children and
died in infancy with all the rest. It is marked
with a small headstone and the single name,
Henry. In the center of the lot a larger stone
records the names of all the members of the family
who lie buried there.</p>
<p>The Hawthorne grave is wholly unsatisfactory.
It is not easily found by a stranger, even after
careful directions. The small lot is inclosed by an
ugly fence, only partially concealed by a poorly
kept hedge. By making an effort one can peep
through and see a simple headstone with the
name Hawthorne. The most conspicuous object
in the inclosure is a big sign warning the public
not to pluck the leaves, etc., and ending with the
curt injunction, “Have respect for the living if
not for the dead.” The unsightly fence and the
rudeness of the sign clang discordantly upon the
sensibilities of those who have been taught to
admire the gracious hospitality and courteous disposition
of the man. We came to gaze reverently
upon the grave of a man whom we had seemed to
know for many years as a personal friend, but
found ourselves treated with contempt as if we
were merely vulgar seekers for useless souvenirs!
Let us get back to the village and see the things
of life.</p>
<p>Next to the Old Manse, the most interesting
house in Concord is Emerson’s. It is southeast
of the public square, at the point where the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page190"></a>190</span>
Cambridge Turnpike joins the Lexington Road.
When Emerson bought it in 1835, it was on the
outskirts of the village and not prepossessing.
He said, himself, “It is in a mean place, and cannot
be fine until trees and flowers give it a character
of its own. But we shall crowd so many
books and papers, and, if possible, wise friends
into it, that it shall have as much wit as it can
carry.” In September of that year, Emerson went
to Plymouth and was married to Miss Lydia
Jackson, in a colonial mansion belonging to the
bride, who suggested that they remain there.
But Concord had charms which the poet could
not sacrifice, so the couple established themselves
in the big house at the southern edge of the
village, where, ere long, the philosopher was dividing
time between his study and the vegetable-garden,
while Lidian, as her husband preferred to
call her, set out her favorite flowers transplanted
from the garden at Plymouth.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">HOUSE OF RALPH WALDO EMERSON</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The first thing that strikes your eye, as you
pass the Emerson house, is the row of great
horse-chestnuts shading its front. Mr. Coolidge,
of Boston, who built the house in 1828, remembered
the lofty chestnuts of his boyhood home in
Bowdoin Square and promptly set to work to
duplicate them when he completed his new country
house. Emerson added to his original two
acres until he had nine, and planted an orchard
of apple trees and pear trees, on which Thoreau
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page191"></a>191</span>
did the grafting. “When I bought my farm,”
said Emerson, “I did not know what a bargain
I had in the bluebirds, bobolinks, and thrushes,
which were not charged in the bill. As little did
I guess what sublime mornings and sunsets I
was buying, what reaches of landscape, and what
fields and lanes for a tramp.” To appreciate the
full extent, therefore, of Emerson’s domain, we
must next visit the favorite objective of his Sunday
walks, Walden Pond, only a mile or two away.</p>
<p>Walden Pond is a pretty sheet of water, about
half a mile long, completely inclosed by trees,
which grow very near to the water’s edge. I
fancy the visitors who go there may be divided
into two classes: first, those who go for a swim
in the cool, deep waters, as Hawthorne liked to
do; and second, those who go to lay a stone
upon the cairn that marks the site of Thoreau’s
hut. It is well worth a pilgrimage, in these days,
to see the place where a man actually built a
dwelling-house at a cost of $28.12½ and lived in
it two years at an estimated expense of $1.09 a
month. One of his extravagances was a watermelon,
costing two cents, and this was classified
in his summary among the “Experiments which
failed!” The site of the hut was admirably
chosen. It overlooks a little cove or bay, and the
still surface of the pond, glimpses of which could
be seen through the trees, reflecting the blue sky
overhead, made a beautiful picture.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page192"></a>192</span></p>
<p>We must now return to the village, for there
are two more houses to be seen, both on the Lexington
Road. The first is the Alcott house, now
restored to something like its original condition
and preserved as a memorial to the author of
“Little Women.” A. Bronson Alcott came to
live in Concord in 1840, having visited there for
the first time five years earlier. Emerson at once
hailed him as “the most extraordinary man and
the highest genius of his time.” He marveled at
the “steadiness of his vision” before which “we
little men creep about ashamed.” The “Sage of
Concord” was too modest and time failed to justify
his enthusiasm for the new neighbor. He
came to admit that Alcott, though a man of
lofty spirit, could not be trusted as to matters of
fact; that he did not have the power to write or
otherwise communicate his thoughts; and that
he was like a gold-ore, sometimes found in California,
“in which the gold is in combination with
such other elements that no chemistry is able to
separate it without great loss.”</p>
<p>Alcott was a “handy man” with tools, could
construct fanciful summer-houses or transform a
melodeon into a bookcase, as a piece of his handiwork
in the “restored” house will testify. But
in intellectual matters he fired his bullets of wisdom
so far over the heads of his fellow men that
they never came down, and therefore penetrated
nobody’s brain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page193"></a>193</span></p>
<p>This lack of practical wisdom came near bringing
disaster to the family. But his daughter came
to the rescue with “Little Women,” a book that
has had an astonishing success from the first.
Originally published in 1868, it has had a circulation
estimated at one million copies and is still
in demand.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1862-63, Louisa M. Alcott
marched off to war, carrying several volumes of
Dickens along with her lint and bandages, determined
that she would not only bind up the soldiers’
wounds, but also relieve the tedium of their
hospital life during the long days of convalescence.
When she was ready to start, Alcott said
he was sending “his only son.” Girl visitors to
the old “Orchard house” take great delight in
the haunts of Meg, Amy, Beth, and Joe, and
particularly in Amy’s bedroom, where the young
artist’s drawings on the doors and window-frames
are still preserved.</p>
<p>Just beyond the Alcott house is a pine grove
on the side of a hill and then the “Wayside,”
Hawthorne’s home for the last twelve years of
his life. When Hawthorne left the Old Manse,
he went to Salem, then to Lenox, and for a short
time to West Newton. In the summer of 1852,
he returned to Concord, having purchased the
“Wayside” from Alcott.</p>
<p>While living in Lenox he had written “The
Wonder-Book,” which so fascinated the children,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page194"></a>194</span>
including their elders as well, that his first task
upon settling in the new home was to prepare,
in response to many urgent demands, a second
series of the same kind to be known as “The
Tanglewood Tales.”</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">
<tbody><tr><td class="figcenter"><img alt="" src="images/img275.jpg" style="width:700px; height:481px" id="id-7814555475354029629"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">THE WAYSIDE</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>In the following spring the family sailed for
Liverpool, where Hawthorne was to be the American
Consul, and from this journey he did not
return until 1860, seven years later. He was
then at the height of his fame as the author of
“The Scarlet Letter,” “The House of the Seven
Gables,” and “The Marble Faun.” As soon as his
family was settled in the Wayside, he began extensive
alterations, the most remarkable of which
is the tower, which not only spoiled the architecture
of the building, but failed, partially at
least, to serve its primary purpose as a study.
It was a room about twenty feet square, reached
by a narrow stairway where the author could
shut himself in against all intrusion. A small
stove made the air stifling in winter, and the sun’s
rays upon the roof made it unbearable in summer.
Nevertheless, Hawthorne managed to make
some use of it and here he wrote “Our Old
Home.” I fancy he must have composed most of
it while walking back and forth in the seclusion
of the pine grove which he had purchased with
the house. And here in this pleasant grove we
must leave him for the present, while we go back
to Boston and thence to Salem, to search out a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page195"></a>195</span>
few more old houses, which would fall into decay
and finally disappear without notice, like hundreds
of others of the same kind, but for the
one simple fact that the touch of Hawthorne’s
presence, more than half a century ago, conferred
upon these dingy old buildings a dignity and
interest that draw to them annually a host of
visitors from all parts of the United States.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page196"></a>196</span></p>
<p class="center pt2">II<br>
<span class="f90">SALEM</span></p>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">On</span> arrival at Salem we inquired of a local
druggist whether he could direct us to any of
the Hawthorne landmarks. He promptly pleaded
ignorance, but referred us to an old citizen who
chanced to be in the store and who admitted that
he knew all about the town, having been “born
and raised” there. Did he know whether there
was a real “House of Seven Gables”? Well, he
had heard of such a place, but it was torn down
long ago. Could he direct us to the Custom
House? Oh, yes, right down the street: he would
show us the way. Any houses where Hawthorne
had lived? Well, no,—he hadn’t “followed that
much.” Had any of his family ever seen Hawthorne,
or spoken of him? Yes—but he didn’t
amount to much: kind of a lazy fellow. People
here didn’t set much store by him.</p>
<p>We were moving away, fearing that the old
fellow would offer to accompany us and thereby
spoil some of our anticipated enjoyment of the old
houses, when he called after us—“Say, there’s
an old house right down this street that I’ve
heard had something to do with Hawthorne. I
don’t know just what, but maybe the folks there
can tell you. It’s just this side of the graveyard.”
We thanked the old man, and following
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page197"></a>197</span>
his directions, soon stood before an old three-story
wooden house, with square front, big chimneys,
and its upper windows considerably shorter
than those below—a type common enough in
Salem and other New England towns. It stood
directly on the sidewalk and had a small, inclosed
porch, with oval windows on each side, through
which one could look up or down the street. In
all these details it agreed exactly with Hawthorne’s
description of the house of Dr. Grimshawe. Adjoining
it on the left was the very graveyard where
Nat and little Elsie chased butterflies and played
hide-and-seek among the quaint old tombstones,
which had puffy little cherubs and doleful verses
carved upon them. That corner room, no doubt,
that overlooks the graveyard, was old Dr. Grim’s
study, so thickly festooned with cobwebs, where
the grisly old monomaniac sat with his long clay
pipe and bottle of brandy, with no better company
than an enormous tropical spider, which
hung directly above his head and seemed at times
to be the incarnation of the Evil One himself.</p>
<p>How could Hawthorne, in his later years, conceive
such horrible suggestions in connection
with a house which must have been associated in
his mind with the happiest memories of his life?
For here lived the Peabody family, Dr. Nathaniel
Peabody and his highly cultivated wife, their three
sons, only one of whom lived to maturity, and
their three remarkable daughters—Elizabeth
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page198"></a>198</span>
Palmer, who achieved fame as one of the foremost
kindergartners of America and died at a
ripe old age; Mary, who became the wife of
Horace Mann; and the gentle, scholarly, and
high-minded Sophia, who refused to come down
to see Hawthorne, on plea of illness, the first
time he called at the house, but fell in love with
him at a subsequent visit. The calls were frequent
enough after that, and before the family left the
old house to reside in Boston, the lovers were
engaged to be married.</p>
<p>During the period of the courtship, Hawthorne
lived with his mother and two sisters in a house
on Herbert Street not far distant, and the two
families came into close neighborly relations. Of
course, we walked over to Herbert Street to find
this house, but what remains of it has been
remodeled into an ordinary tenement house and
no longer resembles the house to which Sophia
Peabody once sent a bouquet of tulips for Mr.
Hawthorne, only to have it quietly appropriated
by his sister Elizabeth, who thought her brother
incapable of appreciating flowers, though she
kindly permitted him to look at them! In the
rear of this building, fronting on Union Street,
is the plain, two-story-and-a-half house, with a
gambrel roof, where Hawthorne was born.</p>
<p>When the Hawthornes returned to Salem, after
their residence in the Old Manse, they occupied
the Herbert Street house, with Madam Hawthorne
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page199"></a>199</span>
and her two daughters, Elizabeth and
Louisa. This proved inconvenient for so large a
family and they moved into a three-story house
on Chestnut Street, well shaded by some fine old
elms. This was only a temporary arrangement,
and soon afterward, the family took a large three-story
house on Mall Street, where the mother
and sisters occupied separate apartments. Hawthorne’s
study was on the third floor—near
enough his own family for convenience, but sufficiently
remote for quiet. It was to this house
that he returned one day in dejected mood and
announced that he had been removed from his
position at the Custom House. “Oh! then, you can
write your book!” was the unexpectedly joyous
reply of his wife, who knew that he had a story
weighing on his mind. And then she produced
the savings which she had carefully hoarded to
meet just such an emergency. “The Scarlet Letter”
was begun on the same day.</p>
<p>It was to this same house that James T. Fields
came in the following winter and found Hawthorne
in despondent mood sitting in the upper
room huddled over a small stove. The preceding
half-year had been the most trying period in his
life. Discouragement over the loss of his position
and the prospect of meager returns for his literary
work was followed by serious pecuniary embarrassment,
for Mrs. Hawthorne’s store of gold
was, after all, a tiny one. The illness and death
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page200"></a>200</span>
of his mother had left him in a nervous state from
the great strain of emotion, and this was followed
by the sickness of every member of the household,
himself included. The story of how Fields
left the house with the manuscript of “The
Scarlet Letter” in his pocket is well known. The
immediate success of the novel proved to be the
tonic that restored the author to health and happiness,
and when he left Mall Street in the following
spring he was no longer the “obscurest
man of letters in America.”</p>
<p>The old Salem Custom House is the best-known
building in the town. As we stood before it and
looked upon the great eagle above the portico,
with “a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and
barbed arrows in each claw” and a “truculent
attitude” that seemed “to threaten mischief to
the inoffensive community,” it seemed as though
we might fairly expect the former surveyor, or
his ghost, to open the door and walk down the
old granite steps.</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">THE MALL STREET HOUSE</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>I have already mentioned the apparent indifference
toward Hawthorne of a certain old citizen
of Salem—a feeling which characterizes a large
part of the population, particularly those whose
ancestors have lived longest in the town. One
would naturally expect Salem to be proud of her
most distinguished citizen, to delight in honoring
him, and to extend a cordial welcome to thousands
of strangers who come to pay him homage.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page201"></a>201</span>
Shakespeare is the principal asset of Stratford-on-Avon,
Scott of Melrose, Burns of Ayr, and
Wordsworth of the English Lakes. Every citizen
is ready to talk of them. Not so of Hawthorne
and Salem. The town is quite independent, and
would hold up its head if there had never been
any Hawthorne. The later generation, it is true,
recognize his greatness, but the prejudice of the
older families is sufficient to check any manifestation
of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>This old Custom House upon which we are
looking furnishes the explanation. When Hawthorne
took possession as surveyor, he found
offices ornamented with rows of sleepy officials,
sitting in old-fashioned chairs which were tilted
on their hind legs against the walls. These old
gentlemen made an irresistible appeal to his
sense of humor, such that he could scarcely have
avoided the impulse to write a description of
their whimsicalities. After his “decapitation” he
yielded to the impulse and prepared in the best
of good humor the amusing description of his
former associates in the “Introduction” to “The
Scarlet Letter.” It brought the wrath of Salem
upon his head. These old fellows did not fancy
being caricatured as “wearisome old souls,” who
“seemed to have flung away all the golden grain
of practical wisdom which they had enjoyed so
many opportunities of harvesting, and most carefully
to have stored their memories with the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page202"></a>202</span>
husks.” Especially enraged were the family of
the Old Inspector of whom Hawthorne said nothing
worse than that he remembered all the good
dinners he had eaten. “There were flavors on
his palate that had lingered there not less than
sixty or seventy years, and were still apparently
as fresh as that of the mutton chop which he had
just devoured for his breakfast,” said Hawthorne
with fine humor. “He called one of them a pig,”
said a Salemite to me, indignantly.</p>
<p>After all, Salem never really knew Hawthorne.
Though the town was his birthplace, he had little
liking for it, and was seldom there. During the
four years of his incumbency of the Custom
House, he kept aloof from the townspeople, most
of whom had no knowledge whatever of his literary
efforts. When the fame of “The Scarlet
Letter” had made Hawthorne’s name a familiar
one throughout America and England, the author
was no longer a resident of Salem, for immediately
after the publication of his first and most
famous novel, he was glad to seek relief from
the gloomy memories of Mall Street in the fresh
mountain air of the Berkshires.</p>
<p>Hawthorne, though apparently glad to escape,
still allowed his thought to dwell in Salem, for in
the same year of the completion of “The Scarlet
Letter” and his removal to Lenox, Massachusetts,
he began “The House of the Seven Gables.”
The identity of this house has long been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page203"></a>203</span>
a matter of curiosity. Three old Salem houses,
two of which have since disappeared, have been
pointed out as originals, the authenticity of all
of which has been denied by George Parsons
Lathrop, Hawthorne’s son-in-law, who maintains
that the author’s statement, that he built his
house only of “materials long in use for constructing
castles in the air,” must be taken literally.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that an author need
ever describe such a building in detail or provide
for its future identification. He may do as Scott
often did, put the details of three or four houses
into one structure, taking his material, not “out
of the air,” but from recollections of many places
he has seen. It does not detract from the supposed
“original” to find that the author has made
material, even radical, departures from the original
plan. The real point of interest is to know
whether the old landmark suggested anything to
the author, and if so, how much.</p>
<p>To those who follow this line of reasoning,
an old house at the foot of Turner Street, now
commonly known as “The House of the Seven
Gables,” has many points of interest. It is a
weather-stained old building dating back to 1669,
and contains so many gables that you are reasonably
content to accept seven as the number,
though I believe it has eight, not counting the
one over the rear porch, recently added.</p>
<p>The identification of this house as the one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page204"></a>204</span>
which, more than any other, suggested to Hawthorne
the idea of a house of seven gables, rests
upon two facts. The first is that in 1782 it came
into the possession of Captain Samuel Ingersoll,
whose wife was a niece of Hawthorne’s grandfather.
It passed, later, to their only surviving
daughter, Susannah. Her portrait, which now
hangs in the parlor of the old house, shows that,
as a young woman, she was not unattractive. An
unfortunate love affair caused her to withdraw
from society and to live a life of solitude in the
old house, from which all male visitors were rigidly
excluded. An exception seems to have been
made in favor of her cousin Nathaniel Hawthorne,
who, it is said, was a frequent visitor and listened
with interest to the legends of the house
as told by his elder cousin.</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">
<tbody><tr><td class="figcenter"><img alt="" src="images/img289.jpg" style="width:700px; height:477px" id="id-7930238986709495775"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The second fact of identification rests upon
more recent evidence. The building was purchased
in 1908 by a generous resident of Salem
and turned into a settlement house. This lady,
who possesses the highest antiquarian instincts,
determined to restore the house to its original
form. In doing so she discovered traces of four
gables which had been removed. These, with
three that remained, made the desired seven, but,
unfortunately, about the same time an old plan
was unearthed which proved that the house at
one time must have had eight gables! So the
house has been restored to its full quota of eight.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page205"></a>205</span>
When Hawthorne was calling there it had only
three gables, and his elderly kinswoman must
have told traditions of the time when it had seven
or eight, as the case may be. And so the question
of gables becomes as bewildering as Tom
Sawyer’s aunt’s spoons.</p>
<p>Aside from this not very profitable speculation,
the house is an interesting survival of the
time when Salem was a seaport town of some
importance. A secret staircase has been reconstructed
according to the recollections of the man
who took it down a quarter of a century ago. It
opens by a secret spring in a panel of the wall
in the third-story front room, now known as
“Clifford’s chamber,” and ascends through a
false fireplace in the dining-room. It will be remembered
how Clifford mysteriously disappeared
from his room, and as mysteriously reappeared in
the parlor where Judge Pyncheon sat in the easy-chair,
dead. Perhaps he came down this secret
stairway, though Hawthorne forgot to mention it.</p>
<p>A little shop, where real gingerbread “Jim
Crows” are sold, makes the present “House of
the Seven Gables” seem real, so that when the
bell tinkles as you open the door, you would not
be at all surprised if Hepzibah Pyncheon herself
should appear, entering from the quaint little
New England kitchen on the right. A sunny
chamber upstairs now called “Phœbe’s room,”
and a pleasant little garden in the rear, still
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page206"></a>206</span>
further heighten the illusion and make one feel
that if this is not the real “House of the Seven
Gables,” it certainly ought to be.</p>
<p>The conditions under which “The House of the
Seven Gables” was written were quite the reverse
of those which brought forth “The Scarlet Letter.”
Instead of obscurity, ill health, and financial
difficulties, the author was now in the full flush of
his fame, reveling in the friendship of the most
distinguished men of letters, enjoying the best
of health himself, and happy in the consciousness
that his dear wife was also well, and living amid
the most delightful surroundings, free from care
and taking no anxious thought for the morrow.</p>
<p>The people of Salem are now preparing to make
ample amends for any neglect of Hawthorne in
the past. A committee of prominent citizens has
been at work for several years upon a plan to
erect a handsome statue upon the Common, the
design for which has been made by a well-known
artist, and a portion of the funds collected. With
this monument before them, we may reasonably
hope that future generations will be able to forgive
the frankness which irritated their ancestors,
though it was kindly meant, and eventually
open their hearts to adopt Hawthorne as their
very own, just as Stratford does Shakespeare,
acknowledging the full extent of their obligation
for the luster which his brilliant genius has
shed upon their town.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">If</span> Thomas Bailey Aldrich were living to-day
and could enter the front door of his grandfather’s
house in Court Street, Portsmouth, New
Hampshire, he would be likely to have a strange
feeling of suddenly renewed youth, for his eyes
would rest upon the same rooms and many of the
same furnishings as those which greeted him in
1849, when he returned to the old house, a lad
of twelve, to enter upon those happy boyish experiences
so pleasantly related in “The Story of
a Bad Boy.” And then, as he passed from room
to room and gazed once more upon the old familiar
sights, he would experience a deeper and
richer joy—a sense of pride, mingled with love
and gratitude, for this unique and splendid tribute
to his memory, from his faithful wife and
many loyal friends.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1907, following the death
of Mr. Aldrich, which occurred in the spring of
that year, it was suggested in a local newspaper
of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, that the old
Bailey house, where “Tom Bailey” lived with
his “Grandfather Nutter,” should be purchased
by the town and refurnished as a permanent memorial
to its distinguished son. The response was
instant and hearty. The Thomas Bailey Aldrich
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page208"></a>208</span>
Memorial Association was at once formed, and a
fund of ten thousand dollars was raised by popular
subscriptions, in sums varying from one dollar
to one thousand dollars. The house, which had
fallen into alien hands and had not been kept
in good repair, was purchased and restored to
its original condition, and the heirs gladly gave
back all that had been taken away at the death
of Grandfather Bailey. On June 30, 1908, the
restored house was formally dedicated by a distinguished
representation of Aldrich’s friends,
including Richard Watson Gilder, William Dean
Howells, Hamilton Wright Mabie, Thomas Wentworth
Higginson, Thomas Nelson Page, Samuel
L. Clemens, and many others whose names are
well known.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">THE BAILEY HOUSE</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The “Nutter” house, or the “Aldrich Memorial”
as it is officially known, impresses one
with a sense of perfect satisfaction. I have seen
memorials that are barn-like in their emptiness,
so difficult has it been to secure a sufficient number
of relics to furnish the rooms; others impress
me like shops for the sale of souvenirs;
others have the cold, touch-me-not aspect of a
museum; and some are overloaded with busts,
pictures, and inscriptions intended to convey an
impression of the greatness of the former occupant.
The Nutter house, on the contrary, looks
as though Tom and his grandfather had gone off
to the village an hour before, and Aunt Abigail
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page209"></a>209</span>
and Kitty Collins, after “tidying” the rooms to
perfection, had slipped away to gossip with the
neighbors. The visitor has a feeling that real
people are living there and is surprised to learn
that at a certain hour each day the attendants go
away and lock it up for the night.</p>
<p>Mrs. Aldrich told us that when her husband
took her there for the first time, as his bride, the
old house made such a strong impression upon
her mind that when she came to restore the place,
many years afterward, she remembered distinctly
where every piece of furniture used to stand.
The perfection of her work is seen in the hundreds
of little touches—the shawl thrown carelessly
over the back of a chair, the fan lying on
the sofa, the books on the center table, the music
on the old-fashioned square piano, grandfather’s
Bible and spectacles on his bedroom table, the
embroidered coverlet in the “blue-chintz room,”
the netting over Aunt Abigail’s bed, the clothing
in the closets, and even the night-clothes
carefully laid out on each corpulent feather bed.
I fancy the most loving touches of all were given
to the little hall bedroom where Tom Bailey slept.
There is the little window out of which Tom
swung himself, with the aid of Kitty Collins’s
clothes-line, at the awful hour of eleven o’clock,
and tumbled into a big rosebush, on the night
before “the Fourth.” The “pretty chintz curtain”
may not be the one Tom knew, but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page210"></a>210</span>
very like it; and there is a very good imitation
of the original wall-paper, on which Tom counted
two hundred and sixty-eight birds, each individual
one of which he admired, although no such
bird ever existed. He knew the exact number
because he once counted them when laid up with
a black eye and dreamed that the whole flock
flew out of the window. The little bed has “a
patch quilt of more colors than were in Joseph’s
coat,” and across it lies a clean white waistcoat
waiting for Tom to put it on, as though to-morrow
would be Sunday. Above the head of the
bed are the two oak shelves, holding the very
books that Tom loved. In front of the window
is the “high-backed chair studded with brass
nails like a coffin,” and on the right “a chest of
carved mahogany drawers” and “a looking-glass
in a filigreed frame.” A little swallow-tailed coat,
once worn by Tom, hangs over the back of a
chair, ready to be worn again. Surely Tom Bailey
is expected home to-night!</p>
<p>Even the garret is ready in case to-morrow
should be stormy. “Here meet together, as if by
some preconcerted arrangement, all the broken-down
chairs of the household, all the spavined
tables, all the seedy hats, all the intoxicated-looking
boots, all the split walking-sticks that
have retired from business, weary with the march
of life.” One slight liberty has been taken, in
placing “The Rivermouth Theater” in one corner
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page211"></a>211</span>
of the attic, next to Kitty Collins’s room, but
this may be forgiven in view of the fact that the
barn, where the “Theater” really was, has disappeared.</p>
<p>In our anxiety to see Tom’s room and the attic,
we have rushed upstairs somewhat too rapidly.
Let us now go down and inspect the other rooms
with more leisure.</p>
<p>In the front of the house, on the second floor,
and at the left of the tiny bedroom which Tom
occupied, is Grandfather Nutter’s room. It was
too near for Tom’s convenience, and that is why
the young gentleman lowered himself from the
window by a rope—at least, that was the reason
he doubtless argued to himself in favor of the
more romantic mode of exit, although as a matter
of fact grandfather was a sound sleeper and
Tom might have walked boldly downstairs without
awakening him. Still he would have had to
pass the door of Aunt Abigail’s room at the head
of the stairs, and if the old lady had suddenly
appeared, Tom could scarcely have escaped a dose
of “hot drops,” which his aunt considered a certain
cure for any known ailment, from a black
eye to a broken arm. Aunt Abigail, it will be
remembered, was the maiden sister of Captain
Nutter, who “swooped down on him,” at the
funeral of the captain’s wife, “with a bandbox
in one hand and a faded blue cotton umbrella in
the other.” Though apparently intending to stay
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page212"></a>212</span>
only a few days, she decided that her presence
was indispensable to the captain, and whether he
wished it or not she kept on staying for seventeen
years, and might have stayed longer had
not death released her from the self-imposed
duty.</p>
<p>On the right of Tom’s room is “the blue-chintz
room, into which a ray of sun was never
allowed to penetrate.” But it was “thrown open
and dusted, and its mouldy air made sweet with
a bouquet of pot-roses” on the occasion of Nelly
Glentworth’s visit, and a very delightful room
Nelly must have found it, if it looked as well
then as it does now, under the skillful direction
of Mrs. Aldrich.</p>
<p>Across the hall from Aunt Abigail’s room is
the guest chamber. An old-fashioned rocking-chair
by the window, with a Bible and candle
conveniently placed on a stand close by, offer the
visitor every opportunity to get himself into a
proper frame of mind before taking a plunge
into the depths of the snow-white mountain of
feathers, hospitably piled up to an enormous
height for his comfort.</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">
<tbody><tr><td class="figcenter"><img alt="" src="images/img301.jpg" style="width:700px; height:478px" id="id-8454291462019182288"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">“AUNT ABIGAIL’S” ROOM</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Descending now to the main floor (for we are
inspecting this house exactly contrary to the usual
order), we step into the large corner room at our
left. Here visions arise of Tom sitting disconsolately
on the haircloth sofa, in the evening, driven
to distraction by the monotonous click-click of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page213"></a>213</span>
Aunt Abigail’s knitting-needles, but sometimes
happily diverted by the spectacle of grandfather
going to sleep over his newspaper and setting
fire to it with the small block-tin lamp which he
held in his hand.</p>
<p>Across the hall is the parlor, which was seldom
open except on Sundays, and was “pervaded by a
strong smell of center table.” Here again we fancy
Tom sitting in one corner, “crushed.” All his
favorite books are banished to the sitting-room
closet until Monday morning. There is nothing
to do and nothing to read except Baxter’s “Saint’s
Rest.” “Genial converse, harmless books, smiles,
lightsome hearts, all are banished.” It was no
fault of the room, however, that Tom felt doleful,
for there is a fine, wide, open fireplace with big
brass andirons from which a wonderful amount
of cheer might have been extracted, while a piano
in one corner and some shelves of books in
another were capable of providing boundless entertainment,
had the room been accessible on any
other day than Sunday.</p>
<p>Passing down through the hall we enter a door
on the left, into the dining-room. Do you remember
how Captain Nutter tormented poor Tom at
the breakfast table, on the morning of the Fourth
of July, by reading from the Rivermouth “Barnacle”
an account of the burning of the stage-coach
the night before? “Miscreants unknown,”
read the grandfather, while Tom’s hair stood
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page214"></a>214</span>
on end. “Five dollars reward offered for the
apprehension of the perpetrators. Sho! I hope
Wingate will catch them,” continued the old gentleman,
while Tom nearly ceased to breathe. And
the sly old fox knew all about it and had already
settled Tom’s share of the damages!</p>
<p>We now cross the hall into the kitchen, which
we ought to have visited first, as everybody else
does. A more delightful New England kitchen
could scarcely be imagined. This was the only
place where Sailor Ben felt at home—and no
wonder, for how could any room have a more inviting
fireplace? Here Tom sought refuge when
oppressed by the atmosphere of the sitting-room
and found relief in Kitty Collins’s funny Irish
stories. And here Sailor Ben gathered the whole
family around the table while he spun his yarn
“all about a man as has made a fool of hisself.”</p>
<p>This is the delightful fact about the Nutter
house of to-day—every room brings back memories
of Tom Bailey, Grandfather Nutter, Aunt
Abigail, Kitty Collins, and Sailor Ben. The furnishings
are so perfect that we should not have
been surprised if any one of these old friends
had suddenly confronted us. Our minds were concentrated
upon their personalities and upon “The
Story of a Bad Boy.” The illusion is so complete
that we scarcely gave a thought to the author
of the tale until we entered the Memorial building
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page215"></a>215</span>
at the rear. Suddenly Tom Bailey vanished
and with him all the other ghosts of the old
house. We stood in the presence of Thomas
Bailey Aldrich, the poet, the writer of a multitude
of delightful tales, and the man of genial
personality. Here, in a single large room, are
brought together the priceless autographs, manuscripts,
first editions, and pictures which Aldrich
had found pleasure in collecting. Here is the
little table on which he wrote “The Story of a
Bad Boy,” and there are cases containing countless
presents, trophies, and expressions of regard
from his friends. The walls are hung with manuscripts,
framed in connection with portraits of
their distinguished writers, as Aldrich loved to
have them. At the end of the room is a handsome
oil painting of Aldrich himself. Everything
tends to suggest the exquisite taste of the man,
his genial nature, his varied attainments, and the
extent of his wide circle of distinguished friends.
Above all, the room speaks in eloquent terms of
the affectionate loyalty to his memory that has led
his family to bring together the material for a
memorial unsurpassed in variety of interest and
tasteful arrangement of details.</p>
<p>Even the garden in the rear of the house is
made to sing its song in memory of Aldrich, for
here are growing all the flowers mentioned in
his poetry, blending their perfumes and uniting
harmoniously their richness of color in one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page216"></a>216</span>
graceful tribute to the beauty and delicacy of
his verse.</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption">AN OLD WHARF</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>After living over again the scenes of “The
Story of a Bad Boy,” in so far as they were suggested
by the Nutter house, it was only natural
that we should wish to stroll about the “Old
Town by the Sea” in the hope of identifying
some of the out-of-door scenes of “young Bailey’s”
exploits. The first house on the right, as
we walked toward the river, is the William Pitt
Tavern. In the early days of the Revolution it
was an aristocratic hotel, much frequented by
the Tories, and kept by a certain astute landlord
named John Stavers. He had formerly kept a
tavern on State Street, known as the “Earl of
Halifax,” and when it became necessary to move
to the newer house in Court Street, he carried
sign and all with him. But the patriots, whose
resort was the old Bell Tavern, kept a jealous
eye on the Earl of Halifax, and in 1777 attacked
it, seriously damaging the building. Master
Stavers, being at heart neither Tory nor patriot,
but primarily an innkeeper, promptly changed
both his politics and his sign. The latter became
“William Pitt,” in honor of the colonists’
English friend and supporter, and the thrifty
landlord began to entertain the leaders of the
Revolution at his house. John Hancock, Elbridge
Gerry, and Edward Rutledge decorated with their
autographs the pages of his register as well as the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page217"></a>217</span>
Declaration of Independence. General Knox was
a frequent visitor and Lafayette came there in
1882. Moreover, the old tavern has had the honor
of entertaining the last of the French kings, Louis
Philippe, who came there with his two brothers
during the French Revolution, and the first
American President, who was a guest in 1789.</p>
<p>All this glory had long since departed in Aldrich’s
day, and his chief interest in the old tavern
lay in the fact that he could climb up the dingy
stairs to the top floor and listen for hours to the
stories of the olden times, as told by Dame Jocelyn,
with whom, as she asserted, Washington had
flirted just a little, though in a “stately and
highly finished manner”!</p>
<p>Continuing down the street, we found the
empty old warehouses and rotting wharves among
which Aldrich spent so many hours of his boyhood,
and we took a picture of one old crumbling
dock, which we felt sure must have been very
like the one upon which the boys of the Rivermouth
Centipedes fired a broadside from “Bailey’s
Battery.” The old abandoned guns, twelve
in all, were cleaned out, loaded, provided with
fuses, and set off mysteriously at midnight, much
to the astonishment of the Rivermouthians, who
thought the town was being bombarded or that
the end of the world had come. The old wharf
possessed a singular fascination for me because
I still recall how vividly the incident impressed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page218"></a>218</span>
me in my boyhood and how fervently I envied
Tom Bailey his unusual opportunities. Nor did
it mar my enjoyment in the least to learn that
the wharf I was looking at was not the right
place, the real one, where the guns were stored,
having been removed some time ago. It was near
the Point of Graves, the spot where the boys
went in bathing and where Binny Wallace’s body
was washed ashore after the ill-fated cruise of the
Dolphin. The real Binny, by the way, was not
drowned at all. The author, here, deviated from
the facts to make his story more dramatic.</p>
<p>Point of Graves takes its name from the old
burying-ground, occupying a triangular space
near the river’s edge. It has quaint old tombstones
dating back as far as 1682, with curious
epitaphs, skulls, and cherubs carved upon them.
Here is the place where Tom Bailey, disappointed
in love and determined to become “a blighted
being,” used to lie in the long grass, speculating
on “the advantages and disadvantages of being
a cherub”—the disadvantages being that the
cherub, having only a head and wings, could not
sit down when he was tired and could not possess
trousers pockets!</p>
<p>A stroll through this part of the town, which
in olden times was the center of its trade and
commerce, is like walking through some of the
old English villages. Every house, nearly, has its
history, and I fancy the streets have not greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page219"></a>219</span>
changed their appearance since the days of Aldrich’s
boyhood.</p>
<p>On the corner of Fleet and State Streets we
came to an old house, which has an interesting
connection with our story. A part of it was occupied
as a candy store for nearly sixty years.
On the Fourth of July, after Tom had treated
the boys to root-beer, a single glass of which
“insured an uninterrupted pain for twenty-four
hours,” they came here for ice-cream. It is said
that one of the ringleaders subsequently celebrated
every third of July, until his death, by
eating ice-cream in the same room. The story
was based upon an incident that really happened
in 1847, in which, of course, Aldrich could have
had no part, as he was not then living in Portsmouth.
I am inclined to doubt whether the real
event was half so delightful as the tale which
Aldrich tells, of the twelve sixpenny ice-creams,
“strawberry and verneller mixed,” and how poor
Tom was left to pay for the whole crowd, who
slipped out of the window while he was in another
room ordering more cream!</p>
<p>No doubt we might have coupled many other
places in Portsmouth with “The Story of a Bad
Boy”—for it is a very real story, though not to
be taken literally in every detail. It is interesting
to think of the town, also, as the scene of “Prudence
Palfrey.” The old Bell Tavern, where Mr.
Dillingham boarded, ceased to exist as a public
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page220"></a>220</span>
house in 1852 and was destroyed by fire fifteen
years later. It is pleasant also to follow Aldrich
in a walk through the streets, with a copy of
“An Old Town by the Sea” for a guide, and
note all the fine old houses he so charmingly
describes.</p>
<p>But we must not devote our entire time to
Aldrich, for an older poet has a slight claim to
our attention. The opening scene of Longfellow’s
“Lady Wentworth,” in the “Tales of a
Wayside Inn,” is laid in State Street.</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“One hundred years ago and something more,</p>
<p class="i05">In Queen Street, Portsmouth, at her tavern door,”—</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p class="noind">is the way the poem opens. Queen Street was the
old name for State Street, and the tavern was the
old Earl of Halifax before Master Stavers carried
the sign over to the new house in Court Street.
It has long since disappeared. It was before this
house that the barefooted and ragged little
beauty, Martha Hilton, was rebuked by Dame
Stavers for appearing on the street half-dressed
and looking so shabby, to which she quickly
replied:—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“No matter how I look: I yet shall ride</p>
<p class="i05">In my own chariot, ma’am.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The house to which she did drive in her own
chariot, many a time in later days, as the wife of
Governor Wentworth, is one of the most pleasantly
situated of all the houses in Portsmouth.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page221"></a>221</span>
It is at Little Harbor, on one of the many peninsulas
that jut out into the Piscataqua, below the
town, and commands a fine view of the beautiful
river and its many islands. The house is a large
wooden building containing forty-five rooms,
though originally it had fifty-two. Architecturally
it is unattractive, external beauty of design
having been sacrificed to utility.</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“Within, unwonted splendors met the eye,</p>
<p class="i05">Panels and floors of oak, and tapestry;</p>

</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p class="noind">The historic building, with its great Chamber
where the Governor and his Council met for
their deliberations, still remains in almost its
original state.</p>
<p>One could spend many days in Portsmouth investigating
its connection with the history of the
country, from the early explorations in 1603 of
Martin Pring and the visit in 1614 of Captain
John Smith, down through the settlements of
David Thomson and Captain John Mason, the
Indian wars and massacres, the incidents of the
Revolution, and the rise and fall of the town’s
commerce, and find plenty of old landmarks to
give zest to the pursuit. But our search, at present,
is for literary landmarks. We, therefore,
take passage on the little steamer that plies to
and from the Isles of Shoals for a pilgrimage
to the Island Garden of Celia Thaxter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page222"></a>222</span></p>
<p class="center pt2">IV<br>
<span class="f90">THE ISLES OF SHOALS</span></p>
<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> is a pleasant sail down the Piscataqua, past
the old “slumberous” wharves, where “the sunshine
seems to lie a foot deep in the planks”;
past the long bridges; the numerous clusters of
islands; the white sails of the yacht club, hovering
like gulls about the huge battleships, moored
to the docks of the navy yard; the ruins of Fort
Constitution, formerly Fort William and Mary,
famed in history, but more interesting to us as
the place where Prudence Palfrey came near surrendering
her heart to the infamous Dillingham;
the ancient town of Newcastle with its old-fashioned
dwellings mingling with pretty new summer
cottages, the whole dominated by the white
walls of a huge hotel; Kittery Point, birthplace
of Sir William Pepperell, the famous Governor
and Indian fighter: and at last, the broad Atlantic,
stretching to the eastward with nothing to
obstruct the view save a few tiny specks, dimly
visible in the distance. These are the Isles of
Shoals, looking so small that they seem to be
only rocks jutting a few feet above the sea, upon
which it would be impossible to land.</p>
<p>As we approach Appledore, the islands still seem
to be only a cluster of barren rocks, with a few
scattered buildings. The charm which they undoubtedly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page223"></a>223</span>
exert upon those who come year after
year does not immediately manifest itself to the
stranger. He must spend a night there, breathing
the pure sea air, watching in the early evening
the glistening lights on the far-off shore, and
finally falling asleep to dream that he is in mid-ocean,
on one of the steadiest of steamers, enjoying
the luxury of absolute rest, for which there
is no better prescription than an ocean voyage.
In the morning, he must walk around the island—it
can be done in an hour or two—threading
the narrow paths through the huckleberry bushes
and picking his way over the high rocks that
present their front to the full force of the waves,
on the side of Appledore that faces the sea.
Here he will see artists spreading their easels and
canvases for a day’s work and less busy people
settling down in various shady nooks, to read, to
chat, to knit, to dream.</p>
<p>To get the real spirit of the islands it is advisable
to find one of these quiet nooks and read
Celia Thaxter’s “Among the Isles of Shoals,” a
book of sketches for which the author needlessly
apologizes, but of which Mrs. Annie Fields says,
“She portrays, in a prose which for beauty and
wealth of diction has few rivals, the unfolding
of sky and sea and solitude and untrammeled
freedom, such as have been almost unknown to
civilized humanity in any age of the world.”
Celia Thaxter is herself the Spirit of the Isles of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page224"></a>224</span>
Shoals, and if we are to know and love them, we
must take her as our guide. She will be found

<p>With this purpose in mind, we began our tour
of the islands, book in hand, stopping first at
the cottage of Mrs. Thaxter. One room is maintained
somewhat as she left it, with every square
foot of wall space covered by her pictures. But
the flower-garden is sadly neglected. Only the
vines that still clamber over the porch, and a
few hollyhocks that stubbornly refuse to die,
remain to suggest the dooryard where the garden
flowers used to “fairly run mad with color.”
The salt air and some peculiar richness of the soil
seem to impart unusual brilliancy to the blossoms
and strength to the roots of all kinds of flowers,
whether wild or cultivated. Celia Thaxter was
one of those people for whom flowers will grow.
They responded with blushing enthusiasm to the
constant manifestations of her love and tender
care. Flowers have a great deal of humanity about
them after all. They refuse to display their real
luxuriance for cold, careless, or indifferent people,
just as babies and dogs know how to distinguish
between those who love them and those who love
only themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page225"></a>225</span></p>
<p>Celia Thaxter loved her flowers with a devotion
born of the hours of solitude when they were
her sole companions. “The little spot of earth on
which they grow is like a mass of jewels. Who
shall describe the pansies, richly streaked with
burning gold; the dark velvet coreopsis and the
nasturtiums; the larkspurs, blue and brilliant as
lapis-lazuli; the ‘ardent marigolds’ that flame
like mimic suns? The sweet peas are of a deep,
bright rose-color, and their odor is like rich wine,
too sweet almost to be borne, except when the
pure fragrance of mignonette is added,—such
mignonette as never grows on shore. Why should
the poppies blaze in such imperial scarlet? What
quality is hidden in this thin soil, which so transfigures
all the familiar flowers with fresh beauty?”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the mysterious quality hidden
in the soil, assisted by the warm sunshine and the
salt air, with all their powers could not maintain
the island garden after the loving hands of its
owner were withdrawn, and the little inclosure is
now a mass of weeds.</p>
<p>Celia Laighton was brought to the Isles of
Shoals as a child of five, and lived with her parents
in a little cottage on White Island where
her father was the keeper of the lighthouse. She
grew to womanhood in the companionship of the
rocks, the spray of the ocean, the seaweeds, the
shells and the miniature wild life she discovered
among them, the tiny wild flowers which her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page226"></a>226</span>
sharp young eyes could find in the most secret
crannies, and the marigolds, “rich in color as
barbaric gold,” which she early learned to cultivate
in “a scrap of garden literally not more than
a yard square.” She shouted a friendly greeting to
the noisy gulls and kittiwakes that fluttered overhead,
chased the sandpipers along the gravelly
beach, made friends and neighbors of the crabs,
the sea-spiders and land-spiders, the sea-urchins,
the grasshoppers and crickets, and set in motion
armies of sandhoppers, that jumped away like tiny
kangaroos when she lifted the stranded seaweed.
And then the birds came to see her. The swallows
gathered fearlessly upon the window-sills
and built their nests in the eaves, seeming to
know that the loving eyes watching their movements
could mean no evil. Now and then a bobolink,
an oriole, or a scarlet tanager would be
seen. The song sparrows came in flocks to be
fed every morning. With them, at times, came
robins and blackbirds, and occasionally yellowbirds
and kingbirds. Sometimes, in hazy weather,
they would fly against the glass of the lighthouse
with fatal results. “Many a May morning,” says
Mrs. Thaxter, “have I wandered about the rock
at the foot of the tower mourning over a little
apron brimful of sparrows, swallows, thrushes,
robins, fire-winged blackbirds, many-colored yellowbirds,
nuthatches, catbirds, even the purple
finch and scarlet tanager and golden oriole, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page227"></a>227</span>
many more beside—enough to break the heart
of a small child to think of.”</p>
<p>It is no wonder that such a sympathetic soul
could even summon the birds to keep her company—as
she frequently did with the loons. “I
learned to imitate their different cries; they are
wonderful! At one time the loon language was
so familiar that I could almost always summon
a considerable flock by going down to the water
and assuming the neighborly and conversational
tone which they generally use: after calling a
few minutes, first a far-off voice responded, then
other voices answered him, and when this was
kept up a while, half a dozen birds would come
sailing in. It was the most delightful little party
imaginable; so comical were they that it was impossible
not to laugh aloud.”</p>
<p>To her love of birds and flowers, Mrs. Thaxter
added a love of the sea itself, finding delight
equally in the sparkle of the calm waves of summer
or the wild beating of the surf in winter.
She developed a marvelous ear for the music of
the sea—something akin to that which enables
John Burroughs to name a bird correctly from
its notes, even when the songster is trying to
imitate the call of another bird as the little impostors
sometimes do. She says: “Who shall
describe that wonderful voice of the sea among
the rocks, to me the most suggestive of all the
sounds in nature? Each island, every isolated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page228"></a>228</span>
rock, has its own peculiar note, and ears made delicate
by listening, in great and frequent peril, can
distinguish the bearings of each in a dense fog.”</p>
<p>Equally well did she know humanity. The
daily life of the fishermen, the kind and quantity
of the fish they caught, the adventures they
experienced, the stories they told, the hardships
they endured, the little domestic tragedies that
now and then took place in their humble cottages,
the sufferings from illness or accident,
were all matters of everyday knowledge to her
and enlisted her profound sympathy.</p>
<p>Everything in nature appealed to her—the
sea and sky, the sunrise and the sunset, the
winds and storms, the birds and flowers, the butterflies
and insects, the sea-shells and kelp, the
fishes and all the lower forms of life—all were
objects of careful observation in which she took
delight; and to these must be added a deep interest
in humanity, particularly of the kind which
she met in fishermen’s cottages, where her good
common sense and knowledge of simple remedies
enabled her to render, again and again, a service
in time of need when no other assistance
could be obtained.</p>
<p>Such was the unique character whose spirit
dominates the islands even to-day,—a lover of
nature worthy to stand with Gilbert White,
Thoreau, or Burroughs, a poet, an artist, a
friendly neighbor, and a womanly woman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page229"></a>229</span></p>
<p>It was a part of our good fortune to have the
actual guidance in our tour of the islands of
the only surviving brother of Mrs. Thaxter, Mr.
Oscar Laighton. In his little motor boat he took
us to the tiny island known as Londoners, where
for many winters he was the sole inhabitant.
Although advancing years have now made it
inexpedient for him to live in solitude, the little
cottage still remains ready for occupancy at any
moment. We stepped inside expecting to see, in
so desolate a spot, only such rude furnishings
as might be found in some mountain cabin or
hunter’s lodge. To our astonishment we found
it a veritable little bower, a model of neatness
and order, and every room, including the kitchen,
filled with well-chosen pictures and books, as
though some dainty fairy, of literary tastes, had
planned it for her permanent abode. Among the
highly prized ornaments were many pieces of
china, painted by Mrs. Thaxter. To our minds,
the most valuable article in the house—valuable
because of the lesson it teaches—is a typewritten
card, hanging conspicuously over the
kitchen stove, with this cordial greeting to the
uninvited guest:—</p>
<div class="condensed">
<p>“Welcome to any one entering this house in shipwreck
or trouble. You will find matches in the box
on the mantel. The key to the wood-house is in this
box. Start a fire in the stove and make yourself comfortable.
There are some cans of food on shelf in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page230"></a>230</span>
pantry. Blankets will be found in the chamber on
lower floor. There is a dory ready to launch in the
boat-house.”</p>
</div>
<p class="noind">Three times have shipwrecked men entered the
house and taken advantage of this kindly welcome.</p>
<p>Our next visit was to White Island, where,
after much difficulty in getting ashore, we
climbed to the top of the lighthouse. This is a
very different structure from the old wooden
building of Celia Thaxter’s childhood and only
a small part of the original dwelling remains.
But the landing is very much as she describes
it. “Two long and very solid timbers about
three feet apart are laid from the boat-house to
low-water mark, and between those timbers the
boat’s bow must be accurately steered....
Safely lodged in the slip, as it is called, she is
drawn up into the boat-house by a capstan, and
fastened securely.” Our boat was not drawn up,
and we had to walk up the steep, slippery planks—with
what success I shall not attempt to describe.
Here, at night, the little Celia used to
sit, with a lantern at her feet, waiting in the
darkness, without fear, for the arrival of her
father’s boat, knowing that the “little star was
watched for, and that the safety of the boat depended
in a great measure upon it.”</p>
<p>Haley’s Island, or “Smutty Nose,” as it was
long ago dubbed by the sailors because of its long
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page231"></a>231</span>
projecting point of black rocks, lies between Appledore
and Star Island. Of the two houses now
remaining, one is the original cottage of Samuel
Haley, an energetic and useful citizen, who once
owned the island. Nearby fourteen rude and
neglected graves tell a pathetic tale. The Spanish
ship Sagunto was wrecked on Smutty Nose, during
a severe snowstorm on a January night. The
shipwrecked sailors saw the light in Haley’s cottage
and crept toward it, benumbed with cold
and overcome with the horror and fatigue of
their experience. Two reached the stone wall in
front of the house, but were too weak to climb
over, and their bodies were discovered the next
morning, frozen to the stones. Twelve other
bodies were found scattered about the island.
How gladly the old man would have given these
poor sailors the warmth and comfort of his home
could he have known the tragedy that was happening
while he slept soundly only a few yards
away!</p>
<p>Star Island, once the site of the village of
Gosport, was in early days the most important of
the group. Before the Revolution a settlement
of from three to six hundred people carried on
the fisheries of the island, catching yearly three
or four thousand quintals of fish. All this business
is now a thing of the past. The great shoals
of mackerel and herring, from which the islands
took their name, have disappeared—driven away
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page232"></a>232</span>
or killed by the steam trawlers. The old families
departed long since, and new ones have never
come to take their places, save a few lobster fishermen,
who with difficulty eke out a bare living.
A quaint little church of stone is perched upon
the highest rocks of Star Island, but I fear the
attendance is small, even in the summer time.</p>
<p>We found our way back to Appledore, content
to spend the remaining days of our visit on
this the largest and most inviting of the group.</p>

A DAY WITH JOHN BURROUGHS</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page234"></a>234</span></p>

A DAY WITH JOHN BURROUGHS</p>
<p class="noind"><span class="chap1 sc">“Oh</span>, everybody here calls him Uncle John,”
was the quick reply to one of my queries
of the man who drove me to the country house of
John Burroughs, near Roxbury, New York. He
had been saying many pleasant things about
the distinguished naturalist, dwelling particularly
upon his kind heart and genial nature. I noticed
that he never referred to him as “Dr.” Burroughs,
nor “Mr.” Burroughs, nor even as “Burroughs,”
but always as “John” or “good old
John,” or most often, “Uncle John.” So I asked
by what name the people called him, and the
answer seemed to me the most sincere compliment
that could have been paid.</p>
<p>When a man has received many honorary degrees
which the great universities have felt proud
to confer, it is an indication that those most competent
to judge have appreciated his intellectual
attainments or public services, or both. When
the people of his native village bestow upon him
the title of “Uncle,” it is an indication that the
achievement of fame has not eclipsed the lovable
qualities in his character nor dimmed the affectionate
regard of the neighbors who have learned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page236"></a>236</span>
to know him as a man. There is a certain friendliness
implied in the title of “Uncle,” while it
also suggests respect. If you live in a small town
you call everybody by his first name. But one
of your number becomes famous. To call him
“John” seems too familiar. It implies that you
do not properly appreciate his attainments. To
call him “Mister” or “Doctor” seems to make
a stranger of him, and you would not for the
world admit that he is not still your friend.
“Uncle” is often a happy compromise, particularly
if he still retains the neighborly qualities
of his less distinguished years.</p>
<p>I do not know that the people of Roxbury
ever followed this line of reasoning, but it does
seem quite appropriate that they should call
their most distinguished fellow citizen “Uncle
John.” He was born on a farm near this little
village in the Catskills on the 3d of April, 1837,
in the very time of the return of the birds. Perhaps
this is why he is so fond of them and particularly
of Robin Redbreast, that fine old-fashioned democrat,
who is one of his prime favorites.
He spent his boyhood here, and now, in the
fullness of his years, quietly returns each summer
to the old familiar haunts, living the same
simple life as of yore, except that the pen is now
his tool instead of the farming implements.</p>
<p>The little red schoolhouse, where Burroughs
and Jay Gould went to school together, may still
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page237"></a>237</span>
be seen in the valley, standing in the open country
with one of those rounded hilltops in the
background which form the characteristic feature
of the Catskills. Near by is the Gould birthplace,
now a comfortable-looking farmhouse, glistening
with a fresh coat of white paint. “Take away
the porch and the back extension, and the top
story and the paint,” said my driver, “and you
will have the original ‘birthplace.’” He said
that when he first began the livery business in
Roxbury many people came to see the birthplace
of Jay Gould, but no one mentioned Burroughs.
Now it is just the other way, and the number of
visitors increases yearly, all anxious to see the
home of the famous philosopher. Yet these two
men, one of whom seems to have belonged to
the generations of the past while the other is a
part of the ever-living present, were boys together
in the same schoolhouse more than sixty
years ago.</p>
<p>As my conveyance drew up to the door, Mr.
Burroughs came out with a hearty welcome. He
was alone, for during the summer, when he retires
to this place for work, he prefers to do his own
housekeeping in his own way. “I am a good
cook,” said he, “but a poor housekeeper.” I did
not agree with the latter part of the statement, for
as I looked around I thought he had about all
he needed and everything was clean. Moreover,
things were where he could get at them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page238"></a>238</span>
from a man’s point of view what better housekeeping
could anybody want?</p>
<p>The house which he now occupies is a plain-looking
farmhouse, built in 1869 by Mr. Burroughs’s
elder brother. Its most distinctive feature
is the rustic porch, a recent addition, which
serves the purposes of living-room, library, and
bedroom. Mr. Burroughs is a believer in fresh
air and during the summer likes to sleep out of
doors. He has a rustic table, covered with favorite
books. When he is not at work, he likes to
sit on the porch and enjoy what he calls “the
peace of the hills.” Across the road there is a
field, broad and long and crossed by numerous
stone walls. In the distance are the hills of his
well-loved Catskills, their smoothly undulating
lines giving a sense of repose. At the right of
the house I noticed a small patch of green corn,
in front of which were some rambling cucumber
vines. In the rear and at the left were a few old
apple trees, and farther back, capping the summit
of a ridge, a fine grove of trees, standing in
orderly array, like an army ready for action.
Mr. Burroughs has named the place, in characteristic
fashion, “Woodchuck Lodge,” “because,”
he said, “I can sit here and count the
woodchucks, sometimes eight or ten at a time.”</p>
<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" data-summary="Illustration">
<tbody><tr><td class="figcenter"><img alt="" src="images/img335.jpg" style="width:530px; height:750px" id="id-7699513117163710244"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption">JOHN BURROUGHS AT WOODCHUCK LODGE</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Not wishing to interfere with his plans, I
expressed the hope that I was not interrupting
him, when he quickly replied, “O, my work for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page239"></a>239</span>
to-day is all done. I rise at six and usually do all
my writing before noon.” “You are like Sir
Walter Scott, then,” said I, “who always began
early and, as he said, ‘broke the neck of the day’s
work’ before the family came down to breakfast
and was ‘his own man before noon.’” “Ah, he
was a wonderful man,” replied Mr. Burroughs.
Then, after a pause and with a little sigh—“I
wish I could invest these hills with romance as
he did the hills of Scotland.” “But you <i>have</i>
invested them with romance,” I said, “although
of a different kind.” “Yes,” he replied, with
brightening eyes, “with the romance of humanity
and of nature, the only kind to which they are
entitled.”</p>
<p>I could not help thinking how wonderfully like
Wordsworth this seemed. The romance of humanity
and nature! Is it not this, which, since
Wordsworth’s time, has given a new charm to the
hills and valleys of Westmoreland and Cumberland,
causing every visitor to seek the dwelling-places
of the poet? And are not those who spend
their summers in the Catskills finding a new delight
in those beautiful mountains because of the
spell which John Burroughs has thrown upon
them?</p>
<p>Wordsworth wrote the history of his own mind
and called it “The Prelude,” intending it to be
but the introduction to a greater poem to be entitled
“The Recluse,” which should be a broad
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page240"></a>240</span>
presentation of his views on Man, Nature, and
Society. “The Excursion” was to be the second
part, but the third was never written. He conceived
that this great work would be like a Gothic
church, the main body of which would be represented
by “The Recluse,” while “The Prelude”
would be but the ante-chapel. All his other
poems, when properly arranged, would then be
“likened to the little cells, oratories, and sepulchral
recesses, ordinarily included in those edifices.”</p>
<p>Burroughs is far too modest to compare his
writings to a cathedral, but he has nevertheless,
like Wordsworth, written himself into nearly all
of them. Following the English poet’s simile
in a modified form, we may think of the product
of his pen, not as a cathedral, but as a mansion
of many rooms, each furnished with beautiful
simplicity and charming taste to represent some
different phase of the author’s mind, and each
equipped, so to speak, with a mirror, possessing all
the magic but without the unpleasant duty of the
one in Hawthorne’s tale, so arranged as to reflect
the very soul of its builder with perfect fidelity.</p>
<p>So sincere is Burroughs that you feel certain
he is constantly revealing his true self. Therefore,
when he praises Wordsworth as the English
poet who has touched him more closely than any
other, you begin to realize the bond of sympathy.
When he says that Wordsworth’s poetry has the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page241"></a>241</span>
character of “a message, special and personal
to a comparatively small circle of readers,” you
know that he is one of the few who have taken
the message to heart.</p>
<p>Wordsworth’s love of Nature was of the same
kind as the American poet’s. “Nature,” says
Burroughs, “is not to be praised or patronized.
You cannot go to her and describe her; she must
speak through your heart. The woods and fields
must melt into your mind, dissolved by your love
for them. Did they not melt into Wordsworth’s
mind? They colored all his thoughts; the solitude
of those green, rocky Westmoreland fells
broods over every page. He does not tell us how
beautiful he finds Nature, and how much he
enjoys her; he makes us share his enjoyment.”
Substitute Burroughs for Wordsworth, and Catskill
for Westmoreland, and you have in this
passage a fine statement of the reason why John
Burroughs is winning the gratitude of more and
more people every year.</p>
<p>Wordsworth thought of Nature as an all-pervading
Presence, something mysterious and sublime,
a supreme Being,—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,</p>
<p class="i05">The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul</p>
<p class="i05">Of all my moral being.”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Burroughs does not rise to such ethereal
heights, but recognizes that the passion for
Nature is “a form of, or closely related to, our
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page242"></a>242</span>
religious instincts.” He lives closer to Nature
than Wordsworth ever did. His knowledge of
her secrets is far deeper and more intimate. He
is a naturalist and scientist, as well as a man of
poetic temperament. He has a trained eye that
sees what others would miss. “There is a great
deal of byplay going on in the life of Nature
about us,” he says, “a great deal of variation
and outcropping of individual traits, that we
entirely miss unless we have our eyes and ears
open.”</p>
<p>Probably no other man has a keener ear for the
music of the birds. He possesses that “special
gift of grace,” to use his own expression, that
enables one to hear the bird-songs. Not only can
he distinguish the various species by their songs,
but he instantly recognizes a new note. He once
detected a robin, singing with great spirit and
accuracy the song of the brown thrasher, and on
another occasion followed a thrush for a long
time because he recognized three or four notes
of a popular air which the bird had probably
learned from some whistling shepherd boy. He
loves to put words into the mouths of the birds
to fit their songs and to fancy conversations between
husband and wife upon their nest. The
sensitiveness of his ear for bird-music is wonderfully
illustrated in his story of a new song which
he heard on Slide Mountain in the Catskills.
“The moment I heard it, I said, ‘There is a new
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page243"></a>243</span>
bird, a new thrush,’ for the quality of all the
thrush songs is the same. A moment more and
I knew it was Bicknell’s thrush. The song is in
a minor key, finer, more attenuated, and more
under the breath than that of any other thrush.
It seemed as if the bird was blowing into a delicate,
slender, golden tube, so fine and yet so flute-like
and resonant the song appeared. At times it
was like a musical whisper of great sweetness and
power.” I do not believe that Wordsworth or
any other poet, however passionate his love of
Nature, ever heard such a bird-song or could
describe its qualities with so keen a discernment.</p>
<p>Mr. Burroughs made me think of Wordsworth
again when, as we sat looking over toward the
Catskills, he explained his residence at Woodchuck
Lodge by referring to his enjoyment of
the open country and the peace and quiet of the
scene. For, says Wordsworth,—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>“What want we? Have we not perpetual streams,</p>
<p class="i05">Warm woods, and sunny hills, and fresh green fields</p>
<p class="i05">And mountains not less green, and flocks and herds</p>
<p class="i05">And thickets full of songsters, and the voice</p>

<p>After an hour of pleasant conversation my
host arose, saying he would build his fire and we
would have our dinner. In due course we sat
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page244"></a>244</span>
down to a repast that would have gladdened the
heart of General Grant himself. The old veteran,
as many will remember, after his return from a
tour of triumph around the world, in which he
had been banqueted by kings and emperors,
dukes, millionaires, and public societies, once
slipped into a farmer’s kitchen for a dinner of
corned beef and cabbage, declaring that he was
glad to get something good to eat. Our meal did
not consist of corned beef and cabbage, but
of corn cakes, made of fresh green corn plucked
not a couple of yards from the kitchen door
and baked on a griddle by one of the foremost
literary men of America. There were other
good things, plenty of them, but those delicious
cakes with maple syrup of the genuine kind exactly
“touched the spot,” as old-fashioned folks
used to say. Mine host must have noticed the
unusual demands upon his crop of corn and marveled
to see the rapid disappearance of the cakes,
but he did not seem displeased. On the contrary,
as he brought in, time after time, a fresh pile of
the steaming flapjacks, his face beamed with the
smile that betokens genuine hospitality. Our conversation
at table was mostly on politics, in which
Mr. Burroughs takes keen interest and upon
which he is a man of decided convictions; but
this is a subject which he must be allowed to
elucidate in his own way.</p>

<p>After dinner, Mr. Burroughs laughingly remarked
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page245"></a>245</span>
that his study was the barn, and we
walked up the road to visit it. “I cannot bear to
be cramped by the four walls of a room,” said he,
“so I have moved out to the barn. I enjoy it
greatly. The birds and the small animals come to
see me every day and often sit and talk with me.
The woodchucks and chipmunks, the blue jays
and the hawks, all look in at me while I am at
work. A red squirrel often squats on the stone
wall and scolds me, and the other day an old gray
rabbit came. He sat there twisting his nose like
this” (here Mr. Burroughs twisted his own nose
in comical fashion), “and seemed to be saying saying—</p>
<table class="reg f90" data-summary="poem"><tbody><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>‘By the pricking of my thumbs</p>
<p class="i05">Something wicked this way comes.’”</p>
</div> </td></tr></tbody></table>
<p class="noind">Arrived at the barn, Mr. Burroughs seated himself
at his “desk.” With twinkling eyes he explained
that it was an old hen-coop. The inside
was stuffed with hay to keep his feet warm, and
if the weather happens to be chilly, he wears a
blanket over his shoulders. A market-basket contains
his manuscript and a few books complete
the equipment. The desk is just inside the wide-open
doors of the barn, and he sits with his face
to the light. “There is a broad outlook from a
barn door,” said he, smilingly.</p>
<p>Beyond the low stone wall, where his animal
friends seat themselves for the daily conversations,
is an apple orchard, and in the distance are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page246"></a>246</span>
the rounded summits of the Catskills—a view
as peaceful and refreshing as the one from the
house. Here Mr. Burroughs is never lonely. One
day a junco, or slate-colored snowbird, came on
a tour of inspection. She decided to build her
nest in the hay. She scorned all the materials so
close at hand and brought everything from outside.
Her instinct had taught her to find certain
materials for a nest, and she could not suddenly
learn to make use of the convenient hay. Mr.
Burroughs, in speaking of this, told me of a
phœbe who built her nest over the window of his
house. She brought moss to conceal it, but as the
moss did not match the color of the house, she
succeeded only in making her nest more conspicuous.
Since the evolution of the species, phœbes
have built their nests on the sides of cliffs, using
moss of the color of the rocks to conceal them.
The little bird who, like the junco, followed her
instincts, failed to note the difference between
the house and the rocks.</p>
<p>In conversation of this kind, Mr. Burroughs
turned the hours into minutes, and I was surprised
to look up and see the team approaching
which was to carry me away. After a reluctant
farewell, we drove over the brow of a hill and
stopped for a few moments before the farmhouse
which was the birthplace of John Burroughs. A
comical incident took place. It was raining hard
when we arrived and we drove into the barn,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page247"></a>247</span>
directly across the road from the house. An old
dog and a young one were here, keeping themselves
dry from the shower. I set up my camera
in the barn, to take a picture of the house. As I
did so, I noticed the old dog walk deliberately
out in the rain and perch himself upon the doorstep,
where he turned around once or twice as if
trying to strike the right attitude. This point
determined, he stood perfectly still until I had
taken the picture, and when I started to put
away the camera, came trotting back to the barn.
I do not know what instinct, if any, prompted the
dog to wish his picture to be taken, but he was no
more foolish than many people,—men, women,
and children,—who have insisted upon getting
into my pictures, though they knew there was no
possibility of their ever seeing them.</p>
<p>Mr. Burrough’s permanent home is at West
Park, on the Hudson River, a few miles south of
Kingston. Here he has a farm mostly devoted to
the cultivation of grapes. He occupies a comfortable
stone house, pleasantly situated and nearly
surrounded by trees of various kinds. Back of the
house and near the river is the study or den, a
little rustic building on the slope of the hill,
where Mr. Burroughs can write undisturbed by
the business of the farm. The walls are partly
lined with bookshelves, well crowded with favorite
volumes. Near by is a small rustic summer
house from which a delightful view of the river
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page248"></a>248</span>
may be seen for miles to the north and to the
south. This is why the place is called “Riverby”—simply
“by-the-river.” It has been the author’s
home for many years.</p>
<p>Even the study, however, did not satisfy Mr.
Burroughs’s longing for quiet, and so he built
another retreat about a mile and a half west
of the village which he calls “Slabsides.” It is
reached by walking up a hill and passing through
a bit of hemlock woods which I found quite
charming. Slabsides is a rustic house like many
camps in the Adirondacks. It is roughly built,
but sufficiently comfortable, and has a pleasant
little porch, at the entrance to which a climbing
vine gives a picturesque effect which is greatly
enhanced by a stone chimney, now almost completely
clothed with foliage. It is in an out-of-the-way
hollow of the woods where nobody would
be likely to come except for the express purpose
of visiting Mr. Burroughs. For several summers
this was his favorite retreat. He would walk over
from his home at Riverby and stay perhaps two
or three weeks at a time, doing his own cooking
and housekeeping. Of late years, however, Slabsides
has been less frequently used, Woodchuck
Lodge having received the preference.</p>
<p>All of these abodes, whether you see them
within or without, reveal the secret of John Burroughs’s
strength. They coincide with his personal
appearance, his dress, his conversation, his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page249"></a>249</span>
manner. It is the strength of absolute simplicity.
Everything is sincere. Nothing is superfluous.
There is no such thing as “putting on airs.”
Fame and popularity have not spoiled him. He
is genuine. You feel it when you see his workshops.
You know it when you meet the man.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Wagner, the apostle of “the simple
life,” has said, “All the strength of the
world and all true joy, everything that consoles,
that feeds hope, or throws a ray of light along
our dark paths, everything that makes us see
across our poor lives a <span class="correction" title="amended from spendid">splendid</span> goal and a boundless
future, comes to us from people of simplicity,
those who have made another object of their
desires than the passing satisfaction and vanity,
and have understood that the art of living is to
know how to give one’s life.”</p>
<p>John Burroughs is one of these “people of
simplicity,” and his contribution to our happiness
lies in his rare power of bringing to his
reader something of his own enjoyment of Nature—an
enjoyment which he has been able to
obtain only through the living of a simple life.
He is the complete embodiment of Emerson’s
“forest seer”:—</p>

GLIMPSES OF THE YELLOWSTONE</p>
<p class="noind"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> Yellowstone National Park is Nature’s
jewel casket, in which she has kept her
choicest gems for countless generations. Securely
sheltered by ranges of rugged mountains they
have long been safe from human depredations.
The red man doubtless knew of them, but superstition
came to the aid of Nature and held him
awe-struck at a safe distance. The first white man
who came within sight of these wonders a century
ago could find no one to believe his tales,
and for a generation or two the region of hot
springs and boiling geysers which he described
was sneeringly termed “Colter’s Hell.” Only
within the last half-century have the generality
of mankind been permitted to view these precious
jewels, and even then jealous Nature, it
would seem, did not consent to reveal her treasures
until fully assured that they would have the
protection of no less powerful a guardianship
than that of the National Government.</p>
<p>On the 18th of September, 1870, a party of explorers,
headed by General Henry D. Washburn,
then Surveyor-General of Montana, emerged from
the forest into an open plain and suddenly found
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page254"></a>254</span>
themselves not one hundred yards away from a
huge column of boiling water, from which great
rolling clouds of snow-white vapor rose high into
the air against the blue sky. It was “Old Faithful”
in action. Then and there they resolved that
this whole region of wonders should be made into
a public park for the benefit of all the people,
and renouncing any thought of securing the
lands for personal gain, these broad-minded men
used their influence to have the National Congress
assume the permanent guardianship of the place.
And now that protection is fully assured these
jewels of Nature may be seen by you and me.</p>
<p>Those who have traveled much will tell you
that Nature is prodigal of her riches, and, indeed,
this would seem to be true to one who has spent
a summer among the snow-clad peaks of the Alps,
or dreamed away the days amid the blue lakes of
northern Italy, or wandered about in the green
forests of the Adirondacks, where every towering
spruce, every fragrant balsam, every dainty wild
flower and every mossy log is a thing of beauty.
But these are Nature’s full-dress garments, just
as the broad-spreading wheatfields of the Dakotas
are her work-a-day clothes. Her “jewels” are
safely locked up in places more difficult of access,
where they may be seen by only a favored
few; and one of these safe-deposit boxes, so to
speak, is the Yellowstone National Park.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">HYMEN TERRACE</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The first collection of these natural gems is at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page255"></a>255</span>
Mammoth Hot Springs, and here my camera, as
if by instinct, led me quickly to the daintiest in
form and most delicate in colorings of them all,
a beautiful formation known as Hymen Terrace.
A series of steps, covering a circular area of perhaps
one hundred feet in diameter, has been
formed by the overflow of a hot spring. The
terraces consist of a series of semicircular and
irregular curves or scallops, like a combination
of hundreds of richly carved pulpits, wrought in
a soft, white substance resembling coral. Little
pools of glistening water reflect the sunlight from
the tops of the steps, while a gently flowing
stream spreads imperceptibly over about one half
the surface, sprinkling it with millions of diamonds
as the altar of Hymen ought to be. The
pools are greens and blues of many shades, varying
with the depth of the water. The sides of the
steps are pure white in the places where the water
has ceased to flow, but beneath the thin stream
they range in color from a rich cream to a deep
brown, with all the intermediate shades harmoniously
blended. From the highest pools, and
especially from the largest one at the very summit
of the mound, rise filmy veils of steam, softening
the exquisite tints into a rich harmony of
color against the azure of the sky.</p>
<p>The Terrace of Hymen is the most exquisite
of the formations, but there are others much
larger and more magnificent. Minerva Terrace
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page256"></a>256</span>
gave me a foreground for a charming picture.
Beyond its richly colored steps and sparkling
pools were the splendid summits of the Gallatin
Range towering more than ten thousand feet
above the level of the sea and seeming, in the
clear mountain air, to be much nearer than they
really are. Hovering above their peaks were piles
upon piles of foamy clouds, through which could
be seen a background of the bluest of skies,
while down below were the gray stone buildings
with their bright red roofs that form the headquarters
of the army guarding the park.</p>
<p>Jupiter Terrace, the most imposing of all these
formations, extends a quarter of a mile along the
edge of a brilliantly colored mound, rising about
three hundred feet above the plain upon which
Fort Yellowstone is built. Pulpit Terrace, on
its eastern slope, reproduces upon a larger scale
the rich carvings and exquisite tints of Hymen,
though without the symmetry of structure. The
springs at its summit are among the most strikingly
beautiful of these unique formations which
I like to call the “jewels” of Nature. Two large
pools of steaming water lie side by side, apparently
identical in structure, and separated only
by a narrow ridge of lime. The one on the
left is a clear turquoise blue, while its neighbor
is distinctly Nile green. Surrounding these
springs are several smaller pools, one a rich
orange color, another light brown, and a third
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page257"></a>257</span>
brown of a much darker hue. The edges of all
are tinted in yellow, brown, and gold of varied
shades. The pools are apparently all a part of
the same spring or group of springs, and subject
to the same conditions of light; yet I noticed at
least five distinct colors in as many pools. The
water itself is colorless and the different hues
must be imparted by the colorings of the lime
deposits, influenced by the varying depth and
temperature of the water.</p>
<p>What is known as “the formation” of the
Mammoth Hot Springs covers perhaps fifty or
sixty acres on the slope of Terrace Mountain. It
is a heavy deposit of lime or travertine, essentially
the same as the stalagmites and stalactites
which one sees in certain caverns. When dry it
is white and soft like chalk. The colorings of
the terraces are of vegetable origin, caused by a
thin, velvety growth, botanically classed as algæ,
which flourishes only in warm water. The heat
of rocks far beneath the surface warms the water
of the springs, which, passing through a bed of
limestone, brings to the surface a deposit of pure
calcium carbonate. Wherever the flow of water
remains warm the algæ appear and tint the growing
formation with as many shades of brown as
there are varying temperatures of the water.
When the water is diverted, as is likely to happen
from one season to the next, the algæ die
and the surfaces become a chalky white.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page258"></a>258</span></p>
<p>Leaving the Hot Springs, the road passes
through the Golden Gate, where, on one side, a
perpendicular wall of rock rises to a height of
two hundred feet or more, and on the other are
the wooded slopes and rocky summit of Bunsen
Peak—a beautiful cañon, where the view suggests
the greater glories of Swiss mountain scenery,
but for that very reason is not to be mentioned
here among the rare gems of the park.
Nor shall I include the “Hoodoos,” which,
though distinctly unusual, are far from beautiful.
An area of many acres is covered with huge
fragments of massive rocks, piled in disorderly
confusion, as though some Cyclops, in a fit of
ugly temper, had torn away the whole side of a
mountain and scattered the pieces. Through
these rocks project the whitened trunks of thousands
of dead trees,—a sort of ghostly nightmare
through which we were glad to pass as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>We stopped for lunch at the Norris Geyser
Basin, and here saw some miniature geysers, as
a kind of preparation for the greater ones beyond.
The “Constant,” true to its name, throws
up a pretty little white fountain so often that it
seems to prepare for a new eruption almost before
the previous one has subsided. The “Minute
Man” is always on duty and pops up his little
spray of hot water, fifteen feet high, every minute
or two. The “Monarch,” near by, is much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page259"></a>259</span>
larger, but not at all pretty. It throws up a
stream of black, muddy water seventy-five to one
hundred feet high about every forty minutes.</p>
<p>Some of these geysers are steady old fellows
who have found their appointed task in life and
have settled down to perform it with commendable
regularity. The Norris Basin, however, seems
to be the favorite playground of the youngsters,—a
frisky lot of geysers of no fixed habits and
a playful disposition to burst out in unexpected
places. Such is the New Crater, which asserted
itself with a great commotion in 1891, bursting
forth with the violence of an earthquake. Another
erratic young fellow is the “Fountain Geyser,”
in the Lower Basin. In July, 1899, he was
seized with a fit of the “sulks” and for three
months refused to play at all. In October he decided
to resume operations and behaved quite
well for ten years, when he suddenly took a
notion to abandon his crater for the apartments
of his neighbor next door. Apparently the furnishings
of his new abode did not suit him, for
he began at once to throw them out with great
violence, hurling huge masses of rock with volcanic
force to a height of two hundred feet.
Amid terrific rumblings and the hissing of escaping
steam, this angry outburst continued for several
days, and did not wholly cease for nearly
two months. Since then the “Fountain” has
settled down to the ordinary daily occupation of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page260"></a>260</span>
a self-respecting geyser. When I saw him he was
as calm and serene as a summer’s day, and to all
appearances had never been guilty of mischief,
nor even exhibited a ruffled temper in all his
life. Indeed, had I not known his history (inconceivable
in one of the gentler sex), I should
have personified this geyser in the feminine
gender, because of his exquisite beauty. A great
jewel seemed to be set into the surface of the
earth. Its smooth upper face, about thirty feet
in diameter, was level with the ground upon
which we stood. Its color, at first glance, seemed
to be a rich turquoise blue, but as we looked into
the clear, transparent depths there seemed to be
a hundred other shades of blue, all blending harmoniously.
In the farthest corner, beneath a shelf
or mound of geyserite, appeared the opening of
a fathomless cave. All around its edges, and
continuing in wavy lines of delicate tracery
around the bottom of the bowl, were marvelous
patterns of exquisite lacework, every angle seeming
to catch and throw back its own particular
ray of bluish light. There was not a ripple to
disturb the surface, not a bubble to foretell the
violent eruption which a few hours would bring
forth, and only a thin film of vapor to suggest
faintly the extraordinary character of this beautiful
pool.</p>
<p>Only a few hundred feet away is another curious
phenomenon in this region of surprises. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page261"></a>261</span>
is a cauldron of boiling mud, measuring forty or
fifty feet in diameter, known as the “Mammoth
Paint Pots,” where a mass of clay is kept in a
state of continuous commotion. Millions of bubbles
rise to the surface and explode, sputtering
like a thick mess of porridge kept at the boiling
point. The color is a creamy white where the
ebullition is greatest, but thick masses thrown
up around the edges and allowed to cool have
assumed a delicate shade of pink. A smaller but
more beautiful formation of the same kind is seen
near the Thumb Station on the Yellowstone Lake.</p>
<p>As we proceeded, Nature’s jewels seemed to
increase in number and magnificence. Turquoise
Spring, a sheet of water one hundred feet wide,
has all the beauty of the Fountain Geyser in the
latter’s quiet state, with an added reputation for
tranquillity, for it is not a geyser at all. Near by
is Prismatic Lake, about four hundred feet long
and two hundred and fifty feet wide. Its center
is a very deep blue, changing to green of varying
shades, and finally, in the shallowest parts, to
yellow, orange, and brown. It is a great spring
from the center of which the water flows in delicate,
wavy ringlets. The mineral deposits have
formed countless scallops, like miniature terraces,
a few inches high, sculpturing a wonderful pattern
in hues of reds, purples, and browns, delicately
imposed upon a background of gray. A
thin veil of rising steam was carried away by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page262"></a>262</span>
wind just enough to reveal the wonderful colorings
to our eyes, while the sun added to the bewildering
beauty of the spectacle by changing
the vapor into a million prisms reflecting all the
colors of the rainbow.</p>
<p>In this connection I must not fail to mention
the Morning-Glory Spring, where the action of
a geyser has carved out a deep bowl, twenty feet
in diameter. It would seem as though Nature had
sunk a gigantic morning-glory into the earth,
leaving its rim flush with the surface and yet retaining,
clearly visible beneath the smooth surface
of the transparent water, all the delicate shades
of the original flower.</p>
<p>The Sapphire Spring, not far away, is another
of the little gems of the region. It is a small,
pulsating spring, and the jewel itself is not less
remarkable than its extraordinary setting, resembling
coral. The constant flow of the waters from
a center to all directions has caused the formation
of a series of irregular concentric circles,
broken into little knobs or mounds, from which
the vicinity takes its name of the “Biscuit Basin.”</p>
<p>As we approached the Upper Geyser Region,
the number and variety of these highly colored
pools, hot springs, geysers, and strange formations
increased steadily, until at last we stood
in the presence of “Old Faithful,” the crown
jewel of the collection, the Koh-i-noor of Nature’s
casket.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page263"></a>263</span></p>
<p>A strong breeze from the north was blowing
as I stood before the geyser for the first time, and
for that reason, I decided to place my camera
directly to the west. A small cloud of steam was
rising, which seemed gradually to increase in
volume. Then, as I watched, a small spray of
water would shoot up occasionally above the rim
of the crater. Then a puff of steam and another
spray, breaking into globules as the wind carried
it away. Then silence. Suddenly a large, full
stream shot up a distance of twenty or thirty feet
and fell back again, and the crater remained
quiet for at least five minutes. Is that all? I
thought. Does its boasted regularity only mean
that while it plays once in sixty-five minutes, yet
the height of some of the eruptions may be only
trifling? I began to feel doubtful, not to say disappointed.
The column of steam seemed smaller,
and I wondered if I should have to wait another
hour for a real eruption, when suddenly the lazily
drifting cloud became a giant, like the genie in
the Arabian Nights. Up into the air shot a huge
column of water, followed instantly by another
still higher, then another, until in a moment or
two there towered above the earth a gigantic column
of boiling water one hundred and fifty feet
high. Straight as a flagstaff it seemed on the left,
while to the right rolled the waving folds of a
huge white banner, obscuring the blue of the
sky in one great mass of snowy vapor. For several
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page264"></a>264</span>
minutes the puffs of steam rolled up, and the
fountain continued to play. Then, little by little,
its form grew less, its force weakened, and at last
there was only the little lazy pillar of vapor outlined
against the distant hills.</p>
<p>Again and again during the day I watched it
with an ever-increasing sense of fascination,
which reached its climax in the evening, when the
eruption was lighted by the powerful search-light
on the hotel. As the great clouds of steam rolled
up, the strong light seemed to impart a vast
variety of colors, ranging from rich cream to
yellow, orange, brown, and purple, blended harmoniously
but ever changing like the rich silk
robes of some Oriental potentate,—a spectacle
of bewildering beauty, defying the power of pen
to describe or brush to paint.</p>

<p>There are other geysers greater than “Old
Faithful.” “The Giant” plays to a height of
two hundred and fifty feet, and the “Grand”
and “Beehive” nearly as high; the “Grotto”
has a more fantastic crater; the “Castle” has
the largest cone, and with its beautifully colored
“Castle Well” is more unique; and the “Riverside,”
which plays a stream diagonally across the
Firehole River, makes a more striking scenic display.
But all of these play at irregular intervals
and with far less frequency, varying from a few
hours to ten or twelve days between eruptions.
On the other hand, the regularity with which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page265"></a>265</span>
“Old Faithful” sends his straight, magnificent
column to the skies is fascinating beyond description.
Every sixty-five or seventy minutes, never
varying more than five minutes, day and night,
in all seasons and every kind of weather, “Old
Faithful” has steadily performed his task since
first discovered in 1870 until the present time,
and no man can tell for how many centuries before.</p>

<p>Not alone as the guardian of Nature’s jewels
is the Yellowstone National Park remarkable.
Even if the wonderful geysers, hot springs, and
many-colored pools were taken away,—locked
up in a strong box and hidden from sight as
jewels often are,—the more familiar phases of
natural scenery, such as mountains, rivers, lakes,
and waterfalls would make it one of the wonder-places
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page266"></a>266</span>
of America. On the eastern boundary is the
great Absaroka Range, with peaks rising over
10,000 feet. In the northwest corner is the Gallatin
Range, dominated by the Electric Peak, 11,155
feet high, covered with snow, and so charged
with electricity as to make the surveyor’s transit
almost useless. The Yellowstone and Gardiner
Rivers, which join at the northern boundary, are
separated within the park by a range of mountains
of which the highest is Mount Washburne
(10,350 feet), named for the leader of the expedition
of 1870. Farther south, and midway between
the Upper Geyser Basin and the Yellowstone
Lake, is the Continental Divide. The road passes
between two small lakes, one of which discharges
its waters into the Atlantic Ocean by way of the
Yellowstone, the Missouri, and the Gulf of Mexico,
while the other flows into the Pacific through
Snake River and the Columbia. From a point a
few miles to the east Lake Shoshone may be seen
far below, and seeming to tower directly above
it, but really fifty miles away, just beyond the
southern boundary of the park, are the three
sentinels of the Teton Range, the highest 13,741
feet above the sea. The entire park is in the heart
of the Rocky Mountains, its lowest level being
over 6000 feet elevation.</p>

<p>The park is full of lakes and streams varying
in size from the hundreds of little pools and
brooks, hidden away among the rocks, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page267"></a>267</span>
great Yellowstone Lake, twenty miles in width,
and the picturesque river of the same name.
Here and there are beautiful cascades which one
would go miles to see anywhere else, but the
surfeited travelers give them only a careless
glance as the stages pass without stopping. The
Kepler Cascades tumble over the rocks in a series
of falls of more than a hundred feet, making
a charming veil of white lace, against a dark
background of rocks and pines. The Gibbon
Falls, eighty feet high, are nearly as attractive,
while the little Rustic Falls, of sixty feet, in
Golden Gate Cañon, are really quite delightful.
These, and many others, are passed in comparative
indifference, for the traveler has already
seen many wonderful sights and knows that
greater ones are yet in store. His anticipations
are realized with good measure running over,
when at last he catches his first glimpse of the
great Cañon of the Yellowstone.</p>
<p>With us this glimpse came at the Upper Falls,
where the Yellowstone River suddenly drops
one hundred and twelve feet, suggesting the
American Fall at Niagara, though the volume of
water is not so great. It is more beautiful, however,
because of the wildness of the scenery.
Lower down, the river takes another drop, falling
to the very bottom of the cañon. Here the
cataract is more than twice the height of Niagara,
and though lacking the width of the stream
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page268"></a>268</span>
that makes the latter so impressive, is in every
respect far more beautiful.</p>
<p>One must stand near the edge of the rocks at
Inspiration Point to grasp the full majesty of
the scene. We are now three miles below the
Great Falls. The Upper Fall, which at close
range is a great, beautiful white sheet of water,
rolling with imperial force over a rocky precipice,
seems only a trifling detail in the vast picture—a
mere touch of dazzling white where all
else is in color. At the bottom is the blue of the
river, broken here and there into foamy white
waves. Pines and mosses contribute touches of
green. The rocky cliffs are yellow and gold,
deepening into orange. In the distance a great
rock of crimson stands like a fortress, with arched
doorway, through which is seen a vista of green
fields. But this is an optical illusion, as a strong
glass will reveal. The doorway is only a pointed
fir, which the distance has softened into the
shadow of a pointed arch. Mediæval castles rear
their buttressed fronts on inaccessible slopes.
Cathedral spires, as majestic as those of Cologne,
and numerous as the minarets of Milan, stand
out in bold relief. Away down below is an eagle’s
nest, into which we can look and see the birds,
yet it is perched upon a pinnacle so high that if
one were to stand at the level of the river and
look up, it would tower above him higher than
the tallest building in the world.</p>

THE GRAND CAÑON OF ARIZONA</p>
<p class="noind"><span class="chap1 sc">I arrived</span> at the cañon on a cold night in
January, 1903, alone. There were few guests
at the hotel, which was a capacious log cabin,
with long, single-storied frame structures projecting
in various directions, to serve the purposes
of sleeping-rooms and kitchens. It had a primitive
look, far more in keeping with the solitude
of its surroundings than the present comfortable
hotel. An old guide (I hoped he might be John
Hance) sat by the fire talking with a group of
loungers, and I sauntered near enough to hear
the conversation, expecting to listen to some
good tale of the cañon. But the talk was commonplace.
Presently an Indian came in accompanied
by a young squaw. He was said to be
a hundred years old—a fact no doubt easily
proved by the layers of dirt on his face and
hands, if one could count them like the rings on
a tree. He proved to be only a lazy old beggar
and quite unromantic. The hotel management
did not provide Indian dances and other forms
of amusement then as now and I was obliged to
spend a dull evening. I read the guidebooks and
reached the conclusion that the cañon was not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page274"></a>274</span>
worth visiting if one did not go “down the
trail” to the bottom of it. So I inquired at the
desk when the party would start in the morning,
and was dismayed to be told that there would
be none unless somebody wanted to go. I was
told to put my name on the “list” and no doubt
others would see it and we might “get up” a
party. I therefore boldly signed my name at the
top of a white sheet of paper, feeling much like
a decoy, and awaited results. Again and again
during the lonesome evening I sauntered over
to the desk, but not one of the few guests had
shown the slightest interest. At ten o’clock my
autograph still headed an invisible list, as lonely
as the man for whom it stood, and I went to
bed, vowing to myself that if I could get only
one companion, besides the guide, I would go
down the trail.</p>
<p>It was still dark when I heard the strident
voice of a Japanese porter calling through the
corridor, “Brek-foos! Brek-foos”! and I rose
quickly. The dawn was just breaking as I stepped
out into the chill air and walked to the edge of
the great chasm. Before me rolled a sea of vapor.
It was as though a massive curtain of clouds had
been let down from the sky to protect the cañon
in the night. The spectacle was not to be exhibited
until the proper hour arrived. The great
white ocean stretched away to the north as far
as the eye could reach, filling every nook and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page275"></a>275</span>
corner of the vast depression. In the east the
rosy tints of the morning brightened the sky.
Suddenly a ray of light illumined what appeared
to be a rock, far out in the filmy ocean, and the
black mass blazed with the ruddy hue. The tip
of another great butte suddenly projected itself
and caught another ray of light. One by one
the rugged domes of the great rock temples of
Brahma and Buddha and Zoroaster and Isis, as
they are called, peeped into view as the mists
gradually disappeared, catching the morning
sunbeams at a thousand different angles, and
throwing back a kaleidoscope of purples, blues,
reds, and yellows, until at last the whole superb
cañon was revealed in a burst of color, over which
the amethyst reigned supreme.</p>
<p>How long I should have stood enraptured before
this scene of superlative grandeur, so marvelously
unfolded to the sight, I do not know,
had not the more prosaic call of “Brek-foos!”
long since forgotten, again resounded to bring
me back to human levels. I returned to the hotel
and entered the breakfast-room, with an appetite
well sharpened by the crisp wintry air, first taking
a furtive glance at the “list,” where my name
still presided in solitary dignity. It was still early
and I was seated at the head of a long table,
where there were as yet only two or three other
guests. I felt sure that the day would be a busy
one, particularly if I should find that one companion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page276"></a>276</span>
with whom I was determined to attempt
the trail. It would be well to lay in a good supply
of fuel, and accordingly I asked the waiter
to get me a good beefsteak and a cup of coffee.
He suggested griddle cakes in addition, as appropriate
for a cold morning, and I assented. Then
suddenly remembering that country hotels have
a way of serving microscopic portions in what
a distinguished author has described as “bird
bathtubs,” I called over my shoulder to bring
me some ham and eggs also. “George” disappeared
with a grin. When he returned, holding
aloft a huge and well-loaded tray, that darky’s
face was a vision of delight. His eyes sparkled
and his thick lips had expanded into an upturned
crescent, wherein two rows of gleaming ivory
stood in military array, every one determined to
be seen. He laid before me a porter-house steak,
large enough for my entire family, an immense
elliptical piece of ham sliced from rim to rim off
the thigh of a huge porker, three fried eggs, a
small mountain of buckwheat cakes, and a pot
of coffee, remarking, as he made room for the
generous repast, “Ah reckon you-all’s powerful
hungry dis mawnin’, boss!”</p>
<p>By this time the table was well filled. There
is no formality at such places and we were soon
chatting together like old acquaintances. I resolved
to open up the subject of the trail and
asked my neighbor at the right whether he intended
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page277"></a>277</span>
to make the trip. He said “No,” rather
indifferently, I thought, and I expressed my surprise.
I had read the guidebooks to good purpose
and was soon expatiating on the wonders of
the trail, declaring that I could not understand
why people should come from all parts of the
world to see the cañon and miss the finest sight
of all, the view from below. (Somebody said that
in the guidebook.) They were all listening now.
Some one asked if it was not dangerous. “Not
in the least,” I replied; “no lives have ever been
lost and there has never been an accident” (the
guidebook said that, too)—“and, besides,” I
continued, knowingly, “it’s lots of fun.” Just
here a maiden lady of uncertain age, cadaverous
cheeks, and a high, squeaky voice, piped out,—“I
believe I’ll go.” I remembered my vow about
the one companion and suddenly felt a strange,
sickly feeling of irresolution. But it was only
for a moment. A little girl of twelve was tugging
at her father’s coat-tails—“Papa, can’t I go?”
Papa conferred with Mamma, who agreed that
Bessie might go if Papa went too. I was making
progress. A masculine voice from the other end
of the table then broke in with a few more questions,
and its owner, a man from Minnesota, whom
we afterward called the “Major,” was the next
recruit. I had suddenly gained an unwonted
influence. The guests were evidently inspired
with a feeling of respect for a man who would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page278"></a>278</span>
order such a regal breakfast! After the meal
was over, a lady approached and prefacing her
request with the flattering remark that I “looked
respectable,” said that her daughter, a young
lady of twenty, was anxious to go down the trail;
she would consent if I would agree to see that no
harm befell her. I thought I might as well be a
chaperon as a cicerone, since I had had no experience
as either, and promptly assured the mother
of my willingness to accept the charge. It was a
vain promise. The young lady was the first to
mount her mule and fell into line behind the
guide; before I could secure my animal others
had taken their places and I found myself three
mules astern, with no possibility of passing to
the front or of exchanging a word with my
“charge.” I fancied a slight gleam of mischievous
triumph in her eyes as she looked back,
seeming to say, “I can take care of myself, quite
well, thank you, Mr. Chaperon!” After a slight
delay, I secured my mule and taking the bridle
firmly in hand said, “Get up, Sam.” The animal
deliberately turned his head and looked back at
me with a sardonic smile in his mulish eye that
said clearly—“You imagine that <i>you</i> are guiding
me, don’t you? Just wait and see!”</p>

<tr><td class="caption">THE TRAIL, GRAND CAÑON</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>There were seven of us, including the guide,
as we started down the long and crooked path.
The guide rode a white horse, but the rest of the
party were mounted, like myself, on big, sturdy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page279"></a>279</span>
mules—none of your little, lazy burros, as most
people imagine. At first the trail seemed to descend
at a frightful angle, and the path seemed—oh,
so narrow! I could put out my left hand
against a perpendicular wall of rock and look
down on the right into what seemed to be the
bottomless pit. I noticed that the trail was covered
with snow and ice. Suppose any of the
mules should slip? Had we not embarked upon
a foolhardy undertaking? And if there should
be an accident, all the blame would justly fall
upon my head. How silly of me to be so anxious
to go! And how reckless to urge all these other
poor innocents into such a trap!</p>
<p>Fortunately such notions lasted only a few
minutes. The mules were sharp-shod and did not
slip. They went down every day, nearly, and
knew their business. They were born in the
cañon. They would have been terribly frightened
in Broadway, but here they were at home
and followed the familiar path with a firm tread.
I threw the bridle over the pommel of the saddle
and gave Sam my implicit trust. He knew a great
deal more about the job than I did. From that
moment I had no further thought of danger.</p>
<p>I came to have a high respect for that mule.
Most people respect a mule only because of the
possibility that his hind legs may suddenly fly out
at a tangent and hit something. I respected Sam
because I knew his legs would do nothing of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page280"></a>280</span>
kind. He needed all of them under him and
he knew it. He never swerved a hair’s breadth
nearer the outer edge of the path than was absolutely
necessary. The trail descends in a series
of zigzag lines and sharp angles like the teeth of
a saw. Sam would march straight down to one
of these angles; then, with the precipice yawning
thousands of feet below, he would slowly
squirm around until his head was pointed down
the next segment and then with great deliberation
resume his journey. The guide thought him
too deliberate and once came back to give me a
small willow switch. I was riding on a narrow
shelf of rock, less than a yard wide, where I
could look down into a chasm thousands of feet
deep. “That mule is too slow,” he said; “you
must whip him up.” I took the switch and
thanked him. But I wouldn’t have used it then
for a million dollars!</p>
<p>It was a glorious ride. The trail itself was the
only sign of human handiwork. Everything else
in sight was as Nature made it—a wild, untouched
ruggedness near at hand and a softer,
gentler aspect in the distance, where the exposed
strata of all the geologic ages caught the sunshine
at millions of angles, each reflecting its
own particular hue and all blending together in
a rich harmony of color; where the bright blue
sky and the fleecy clouds came down to join their
earthly brethren in a revelry of rainbow tints,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page281"></a>281</span>
and the sun overhead, despite the snow about the
rim, was smiling his happiest summer benison
upon the deep valley.</p>
<p>We came, presently, to a place called Jacob’s
Ladder, where the path ceased to be an inclined
plane and became a series of huge steps, each
about as high as an ordinary table. Here we all
dismounted, for the mules could not safely descend
with such burdens. It was comical to watch
them. My Sam would stand on each step for
several minutes, gazing about as though enjoying
the scenery. Then, as if struck by a sudden
notion, he would drop his fore legs to the next
step, and with hind legs still at the higher elevation,
pause in further contemplation. At length
it would occur to this deliberate animal that his
hind legs, after all, really belonged on the same
level with the other two, and he would suddenly
drop them down and again become rapt in
thought. This performance was repeated on
every step for the entire descent of more than
one hundred feet.</p>
<p>After traveling about three hours, during
which we had descended three thousand feet below
the rim, we came to Indian Garden, where
an Indian family once found a fertile spot on
which they could practice farming in their own
crude way. Here we came to some tents belonging
to a camping-party, and I found the solution
of a problem that had puzzled me earlier in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page282"></a>282</span>
the day. Standing on the rim and looking across
the cañon I had seen what appeared to be a
newspaper lying on the grass. I knew it must
be three or four miles from where I stood, and
that a newspaper would be invisible at that distance,
yet I could not imagine how any natural
object could appear white and rectangular so far
away. Presently I saw some tiny objects moving
slowly like a string of black ants, and realized
that these must be some early trail party. We
met them at Indian Garden. They proved to be
prospectors and the “newspaper” was in reality
the group of tents.</p>
<p>We had now left the steep zigzag path, and
riding straight forward over a great plateau, we
came to the brink of some granite cliffs, where
we could at last see the Colorado River, thundering
through the gorge thirteen hundred feet
below. And what a river it is! From the rim we
could only catch an occasional glimpse, looking
like a narrow silver ribbon, threading in and out
among a multitude of strangely fashioned domes
and turrets. Here we saw something of its true
character, though still too far away to feel its
real power—a boiling, turbulent, angry, and
useless stream dashing wildly through a barren
valley of rock and sand, its waters capable of
generating millions of horse-power, but too inaccessible
to be harnessed, and its surface violently
resisting the slightest attempt at navigation;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page283"></a>283</span>
a veritable anarchist of a river! For more
than a thousand miles it rushes through a deep
cañon toward the sea, falling forty-two hundred
feet between its source and mouth and for five
hundred miles of its course tumbling in a series
of five hundred and twenty cataracts and rapids—an
average of slightly more than one to every
mile.</p>
<p>Think of the courage of brave Major Powell
and his men, who descended this terrible river for
the first time, and you have a subject for contemplation
as sublime as the cañon itself. In the
spring of 1869, when John W. Powell started on
his famous expedition, the Grand Cañon was
totally unknown. Hunters and prospectors had
seen enough to bring back wonderful stories.
Parties had ventured into the gorge in boats and
had never been heard of again. The Indians
warned him that the cañon was sacred to the
gods, who would consider any attempt to enter
it an act of disobedience to their wishes and contempt
for their authority, and vengeance would
surely follow. The incessant roar of the waters
told of many cataracts and it was currently reported
that the river was lost underground for
several hundred miles. Undaunted by these fearful
tales, Major Powell, who had seen service in
the Civil War, leaving an arm on the battlefield
of Shiloh, determined, nevertheless, to descend
the river. He had long been a student of botany,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page284"></a>284</span>
zoölogy, and mineralogy and had devoted two
years to a study of the geology of the region.</p>
<p>With nine other men as his companions, he
started from Green River City, Wyoming, on the
24th of May, with one light boat of pine and
three heavy ones built of oak. Nothing could be
more modest than his report to the Government,
yet it is an account of thrilling adventures and
hair-breadth escapes, day by day, almost too marvelous
for belief. Yet there is not the slightest
doubt of its authenticity in every detail. At times
the swift current carried them along with the speed
of an express train, the waves breaking and rolling
over the boats, which, but for the water-tight
compartments, must have been swamped at the
outset.</p>
<p>When a threatening roar gave warning of another
cataract they would pull for the shore and
prepare to make a portage. The boats were unloaded
and the stores of provisions, instruments,
etc., carried down to some convenient point below
the falls. Then the boats were let down, one
by one. The bow line would be taken below and
made fast. Then with five or six men holding
back on the stern line with all their strength,
the boat would be allowed to go down as far as
they could hold it, when the line would be cast
off, the boat would leap over the falls, and be
caught by the lower rope. Again and again, day
after day throughout the entire summer, this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page285"></a>285</span>
hard work was continued. In the early evenings
and mornings Major Powell, with a companion
or two, would climb to the top of the high cliffs,
towering to a height of perhaps two thousand
or three thousand feet above the river, to make
his observations, frequently getting into dangerous
positions where a man with two arms would
have difficulty in clinging to the rocks, and
where any one but a man of iron nerve would
have met instant death.</p>
<p>Day by day they faced what seemed certain
destruction, dashing through rapids, spinning
about in whirlpools, capsizing in the breakers,
and clinging to the upturned boats until rescued
or thrown up on some rocky islet, breaking their
oars, losing or spoiling their rations until they
were nearly gone, and toiling incessantly every
waking hour. One of the boats was completely
wrecked before they had crossed the Arizona
line, and one man, who barely escaped death in
this accident, left the party on July 5, declaring
that he had seen danger enough. The remaining
eight, whether from loyalty to their chief or because
it seemed impossible to climb to the top
of the chasm, continued to brave the perils of
the river until August 27, when they had reached
a point well below the mouth of the Bright Angel
River. Here the danger seemed more appalling
than at any previous time. Lateral streams had
washed great boulders into the river, forming a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page286"></a>286</span>
dam over which the water fell eighteen or twenty
feet; then appeared a rapid for two or three
hundred yards on one side, the walls of the
cañon projecting sharply into the river on the
other; then a second fall so great that its height
could not be determined, and beyond this more
rapids, filled with huge rocks for one or two
hundred yards, and at the bottom a great rock
jutting halfway across the river, having a sloping
side up which the tumbling waters dashed
in huge breakers. After spending the afternoon
clambering among the rocks to survey the river
and coolly calculating his chances, the dauntless
Powell announced his intention to proceed. But
there were three men whose courage was not
equal to this latest demand, and they firmly declined
the risk.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 28th, after a breakfast
that seemed like a funeral, the three deserters—one
can scarcely find the heart to blame them—climbed
a crag to see their former comrades
depart. One boat is left behind. The other two
push out into the stream and in less than a minute
have safely run the dangerous rapids, which
seemed bad enough from above, but were in
reality less difficult than many others previously
experienced. A succession of rapids and falls are
safely run, but after dinner they find themselves
in another bad place. The river is tumbling
down over the rocks in whirlpools and great
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page287"></a>287</span>
waves and the angry waters are lashed into white
foam. There is no possibility of a portage and
both boats must go over the falls. Away they
go, dashing and plunging, striking the rocks
and rolling over and over until they reach the
calmer waters below, when as if by miracle it is
found that every man in the party is uninjured
and both the boats are safe. By noon of the
next day they have emerged from the Grand
Cañon into a valley where low mountains can
be seen in the distance. The river flows in silent
majesty, the sky is bright overhead, the birds
pour forth the music of a joyous welcome, the
toil and pain are over, the gloomy shadows have
disappeared, and their joy is exquisite as they
realize that the first passage of the long and terrible
river has been safely accomplished and all
are alive and well.</p>
<p>But what of the three who left them? If only
they could have known that safety and joy were
little more than a day ahead! They successfully
climbed the steep cañon walls, only to encounter
a band of Indians who were looking for cattle
thieves or other plunderers. They could give no
other account of their presence except to say they
had come down the river. This, to the Indian
mind, was so obviously an impossibility that the
truth seemed an audacious lie and the three unfortunate
men were murdered.</p>
<p>We were obliged to content ourselves with a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288"></a>288</span>
view of the river from this height, though I had
expected to descend to the river’s edge and felt
correspondingly disappointed. We had started
too late for so long a trip and now it was time to
turn back. Looking back at the solid and apparently
perpendicular rock, nearly a mile high, it
seemed impossible that any one could ascend to
the top. It is only when one looks out from the
bottom of this vast chasm at the huge walls on
every side that he begins to realize its awfulness.
We are mere specks in the bottom of a gigantic
mould wherein some great mountain range might
have been cast. There are great mountains all
about us and yet we are not on a mountain but in a
vast hole. The surface of the earth is above us. A
great gash has been cut into it, two hundred miles
long, twelve to fifteen miles wide, and a mile deep,
and we are in the depths of that frightful abyss
with—to all appearance—no possible means of
escape. Perpendicular cliffs of enormous height,
which not even a mountain sheep could climb, hem
us in on every side. The shadows are growing deep
and it seems that the day must be nearly done. Yet
we remount our mules and slowly retrace our
steps over the steep ascent. It seems as though
the strain would break the backs of the animals.
As we approached the summit of the path some
one remarked, “I should think these mules would
be so tired they would be ready to drop.” “Wait
and see,” said the guide. A few minutes later we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page289"></a>289</span>
reached the top and dismounted, feeling pretty
stiff from the exertion. The mules were unsaddled
and turned loose. Away they scampered like a
lot of schoolboys at recess, kicking their heels
high in the air and racing madly across the field.
“I guess they’re not as tired as we are,” said
the Major, as he painfully tried to straighten
up. Just then the little girl of twelve came up to
me. “There is one thing,” she said, “that has
been puzzling me all day. How in the world did
you find out so quickly that your mule’s name was
Sam?” “Name ain’t Sam,” interrupted the guide,
bluntly. “Name’s Teddy—Teddy Roosevelt.”</p>
<p>Some years ago I had occasion to attend a
stereopticon lecture on the Grand Cañon. The
speaker was enthusiastic and his pictures excellent.
But he fired off all his ammunition of adjectives
with the first slide. For an hour and a
half we sat listening to an endless repetition of
“grand,” “magnificent,” “sublime,” “awe-inspiring,”
etc. As we walked home a young lad
in our party, who was evidently studying rhetoric
in school, was heard to inquire, “Mother,
wouldn’t you call that an example of tautology?”
I fear I should merit the same criticism if I were
to undertake a description of the cañon. Yet
we may profitably stand, for a few moments, on
Hopi Point, a promontory that projects far out
from the rim, and try to measure it with our eyes.</p>
<p>That great wall on the opposite side is just
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page290"></a>290</span>
thirteen miles away. The strip of white at its
upper edge, which in my photograph measures
less than a quarter of an inch, is a stratum of
limestone five hundred feet thick. Here and there
we catch glimpses of the river. It is five miles
away, and forty-six hundred feet—nearly a perpendicular
mile—below the level upon which we
are standing. We look to the east and then to the
west, but we see only a small part of the chasm.
It melts away in the distance like a ship at sea.
From end to end it is two hundred and seventeen
miles. It is not one cañon, but thousands. Every
river that runs into the Colorado has cut out its
own cañon, and each of these has its countless
tributaries. It has been estimated that if all the
cañons were placed end to end in a straight line
they would stretch twenty thousand miles.</p>

<p>If this mighty gash in the earth’s surface were
only a great valley with gently sloping sides and
a level floor, it would still be impressive and inspiring,
though not so picturesque. But its floor
is filled with a multitude of temples and castles
and amphitheaters of stupendous size, all sculptured
into strange shapes by the erosion of the
waters. Any one of these, if it could be transported
to the level plains of the Middle West or
set up on the Atlantic Coast, would be an object
of wonder which hundreds of thousands would
visit. Away off in the distance is the Temple of
Shiva, towering seventy-six hundred and fifty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page291"></a>291</span>
feet above the sea and fifty-two hundred and
fourteen feet (nearly a mile) above the river.
Take it to the White Mountains and set it down
in the Crawford Notch. From its summit you
would look down upon the old Tip-Top house of
Mount Washington, eight hundred feet below.
Much nearer, and a little to the right, is the
“Pyramid of Cheops,” a much smaller butte but
rising fifty-three hundred and fifty feet above
the sea-level. If the “Great Pyramid of Cheops”
in Egypt were to be placed by its side it would
scarcely be visible from where we stand, for it
would be lost in the mass of rocky formations.
Mr. G. Wharton James, who has spent many
years of his life in the study of the cañon, says
that he gazed upon it from a certain point every
year for twenty years and often daily for weeks
at a time. He continues, “Such is the marvelousness
of distance that never until two days ago
did I discover that a giant detached mountain
fully eight thousand feet high and with a base
ten miles square ... stood in the direct line of
my sight, and as it were, immediately before me.”
He discovered it only because of a peculiarity of
the light. It had always appeared as a part of
the great north wall, though separated from it by
a cañon fully eight miles wide.</p>
<p>How are we to realize these enormous depths?
Those isolated peaks and mountains, of which
there are hundreds, are really only details in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page292"></a>292</span>
the vast stretch of the cañon. Not one of them
reaches above the level of the plain on the north
side. Tourists who have traveled much are familiar
with the great cathedrals of Europe. Let us
drop a few of them into the cañon. First, St.
Peter’s, the greatest cathedral in the world. We
lower it to the level of the river, and it disappears
behind the granite cliff. Let the stately Duomo
of Milan follow. Its beautiful minarets and multitude
of statues are lost in the distance, and
though we place it on the top of St. Peter’s, it, too,
is out of sight behind the cliffs. We must have
something larger, so we place on top of Milan
the great cathedral of Cologne, five hundred and
one feet high, and the tips of its two great spires
barely appear above the point from which we
watched the swiftly rolling river. Now let us poise
on the top of Cologne’s spires, two great Gothic
cathedrals of France, Notre Dame and Amiens,
one above the other, then add St. Paul’s of London,
the three great towers of Lincoln, the triple spires
of Lichfield, Canterbury with its great central
tower, and the single spire, four hundred and
four feet high, of Salisbury. We are still far from
the top. These units of measurement are too
small. Let us add the tallest office building in
the world, seven hundred and fifty feet high, and
then the Eiffel Tower, of nine hundred and
eighty-six feet. We shall still need the Washington
Monument, and if my calculations are correct,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page293"></a>293</span>
an extension ladder seventy-five feet long
on top of that, to enable us to reach the top of
the northern wall. One might amuse himself indefinitely
with such comparisons. Perhaps they
are futile, but it is only by some such method
that one can form the faintest conception of the
colossal dimensions of this, the greatest chasm
in the world.</p>
<p>Still more bewildering is the attempt to measure
the cañon in periods of time. There were
two great periods in its history—first, the period
of upheaval, and second, that of erosion.
When the geologic movement was in process
which created the continent, with the Rocky
Mountains for its backbone, this entire region
became a plateau, vastly higher than at present,
with its greatest elevation far to the north. Then
the rivers began to carry the rains and snows to
the sea, carving channels for themselves through
the rocky surface. The steep decline caused the
waters to flow with swiftness. The little streamlets
united to form larger ones, and these in
turn joined their waters in still greater streams.
The larger the stream and the swifter the flow,
the faster the channel would be carved. The
softer rocks gave slight resistance, but when the
granite or harder formations were encountered,
the streams would eddy and whirl about in search
of new channels, the hard rocks forming a temporary
dam. In this way the hundreds of buttes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page294"></a>294</span>
were formed. The Green River and the Grand
unite to form the Colorado, the entire course of
this great waterway stretching for two thousand
miles. The two streams carry down a mighty
flood—in former ages it was far mightier than
now—which in its swift descent has ground the
rocks into sand and silt and with resistless force
carried them down to the sea. Those great buttes
and strangely sculptured temples, each a formidable
mountain, were not thrown up by volcanic
forces, but have been carved out of the solid
earth by the erosion of the waters. That river
five miles away, of which we see only glimpses
here and there, was the tool with which the
Great Sculptor carved all this wondrous chasm.
Major Powell has calculated that the amount of
rock thus ground to pieces and carried away
would be equivalent to a mass two hundred thousand
square miles in area and a full mile in thickness.
Think of excavating a mile deep the entire
territory of New England, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and West
Virginia, and dumping it all into the Atlantic.
Then think that this is the task the Colorado
River and other geologic forces have accomplished,
and pause to wonder how long it took
to complete the process! If the Egyptian kings
who built the pyramids had come here for material
they would have seen the chasm substantially
as we see it!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page295"></a>295</span></p>
<p>The geologic story of the cañon’s origin is too
far beyond our comprehension. Let us turn to
the Indian account. A great chief lost his wife
and refused to be comforted. An Indian God,
Ta-vwoats, came to him and offered to conduct
him to a happier land where he might see her,
if he would promise to cease mourning. Then
Ta-vwoats made a trail through the mountains
to the happy land and there the chief saw his
wife. This trail was the cañon of the Colorado.
The deity made the chief promise that he would
reveal the path to no man, lest all might wish to
go at once to heaven, and in order to block the
way still more effectually he rolled a mad surging
river through the gorges so swift and strong
that it would destroy any one who dared attempt
to enter heaven by that route.</p>
<p>I have often been asked which is the greater
wonder, the Grand Cañon of the Colorado River
or the Yellowstone National Park. The question
is unanswerable. One might as well attempt to
say whether the sea is more beautiful than the
sky. If mere size is meant, the Grand Cañon is
vastly greater. If all the geysers of the Yellowstone
were placed down in the bottom of the
Grand Cañon at the level of the river, and all
were to play at once, the effect would be unnoticed
from Hopi Point. The cañon of the Yellowstone
River, impressive as it is, would be lost in
one of the side cañons of the Colorado.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page296"></a>296</span></p>
<p>The Grand Cañon and the Yellowstone are
creations of a totally different kind.</p>
<p>The Yellowstone is a garden of wonders. The
Grand Cañon is a sublime spectacle.</p>
<p>The Yellowstone is a variety of interesting
units. The Grand Cañon is a unit of infinite
variety.</p>
<p>The Yellowstone contains a collection of individual
marvels, each wondrous in structure and
many of them exquisite in beauty. The Grand
Cañon is one vast masterpiece of unimagined
architecture, limitless grandeur, and ever-changing
but splendidly harmonious brilliancy of color.</p>
<p>The Yellowstone fills the mind with wonder
and amazement at all the varied resources of
Nature. The Grand Cañon fills the soul with
awe and reverence as one stands in silence upon
the brink and humbly reflects upon the infinite
power of God.</p>
