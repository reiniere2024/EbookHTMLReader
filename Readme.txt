Hi All,

This is my EBook HTML Reader that I use for reading books with
text and images in HTML format. Included are Books for Art, Kids,
Photography, Recipes and Travel and more subjects can be added.

New HTML Books can be found mainly on Gutenberg.org but it is also
possible to convert all other EBooks in epub/mobi format to HTML
using the program Sigil.

Just download the HTML zip version from Gutenberg. Unpack the 
zip-file and you will get a directory containing a html file and a 
map containing images. Rename the directory and html file and add
the directory then to the "EBooks" folder of the program.

When you open the solution in Visual Studio 2008 then don't forget to
move the maps XML and EBooks to the bin/debug directory when you
want to run the code.

Good luck,
Reiniere.
